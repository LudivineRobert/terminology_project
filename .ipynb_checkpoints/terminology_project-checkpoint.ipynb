      " Introduction \n",
      "\n",
      " The goal of this work is to build a [TTS system] which can generate natural [speech] for a variety of speakers in a data efficient manner. \n",
      " We specifically address a zero-shot learning setting, where a few seconds of untranscribed reference [audio] from a [target speaker] is used to synthesize new [speech] in that [speakerâs voice], without updating any model parameters. \n",
      " Such systems have accessibility applications, such as restoring the ability to communicate naturally to users who have lost their [voice] and are therefore unable to provide many new training examples. \n",
      " They could also enable new applications, such as transferring a [voice] across languages for more natural [speech-to-speech translation], or generating realistic [speech] from text in low resource settings. \n",
      " However, it is also important to note the potential for misuse of this technology, for example impersonating someoneâs [voice] without their consent. \n",
      " In order to address safety concerns consistent with principles such as, we verify that [voices] generated by the proposed model can easily be distinguished from [real voices]. \n",
      " Synthesizing natural [speech] requires training on a large number of high quality [speech]-transcript pairs, and supporting [many speakers] usually uses tens of minutes of [training data per] speaker. \n",
      " Recording a large amount of high [quality data] for [many speakers] is impractical. \n",
      " Our approach is to [decouple speaker] modeling from [speech synthesis] by independently training a speaker-discriminative embedding network that captures the space of [speaker characteristics] and training a high quality [TTS model] on a [smaller dataset] conditioned on the representation learned by the first network. \n",
      " Decoupling the networks enables them to be trained on [independent data], which reduces the need to obtain high quality multispeaker [training data]. \n",
      " We train the speaker embedding network on a [speaker verification] task to determine if two different utterances were spoken by the [same speaker]. \n",
      " In contrast to the subsequent [TTS model], this network is trained on untranscribed [speech] containing reverberation and background noise from a large number of speakers. \n",
      " We demonstrate that the [speaker encoder] and synthesis networks can be trained on unbalanced and disjoint sets of speakers and still generalize well. \n",
      " We train the synthesis network on. \n",
      " 2000 speakers and show that training the [encoder] on a much larger set of 18000 speakers improves adaptation quality, and further enables synthesis of completely [novel speakers] by sampling from the embedding prior. \n",
      " There has been significant interest in [end-to-end training] of [TTS models], which are trained directly from text-[audio pairs], without depending on hand crafted intermediate representations. \n",
      " [Tacotron] 2 used [WaveNet] as a [vocoder] to invert [spectrograms] generated by an [encoder-decoder architecture] with attention, obtaining naturalness approaching that of human [speech] by combining Tacotronâsprosody with [WaveNet]âs [audio quality]. \n",
      " It only supported a [single speaker]. \n",
      " Gibiansky et al. ntroduced a multispeaker variation of [Tacotron] which learned low-[dimensional speaker] embedding for each [training speaker]. \n",
      " [Deep Voice] 3proposed a fully [convolutional encoder-decoder architecture] which scaled up to support over 2,400 speakers from [LibriSpeech]. \n",
      " These systems learn a fixed set of [speaker embeddings] and therefore only support synthesis of [voices] seen during training. \n",
      " In contrast, VoiceLoop proposed a novel architecture based on a fixed size memory buffer which can generate [speech] from [voices] unseen during training. \n",
      " Obtaining good results required tens of minutes of enrollment [speech] and transcripts for a [new speaker]. \n",
      " Recent extensions have enabled few-[shot speaker] adaptation where only a few seconds of [speech per] speaker (without transcripts) can be used to generate new [speech] in that speakerâs [voice]. \n",
      " extends [Deep Voice] 3, comparing a [speaker adaptation] method similar to where the model parameters (including [speaker embedding]) are fine-tuned on a small amount of [adaptation data] to a [speaker encoding] method which uses a [neural network] to predict speaker embedding directly from a [spectrogram]. \n",
      " The latter approach is significantly [more data] efficient, obtaining higher naturalness using small amounts of [adaptation data], in as few as one or two utterances. \n",
      " It is also significantly more computationally efficient since it does not require hundreds of backpropagation iterations. \n",
      " Nachmani et al.   similarly extended VoiceLoop to utilize a [target speaker] encoding network to predict a [speaker embedding]. \n",
      " This network is trained jointly with the synthesis network using a contrastive triplet loss to ensure that embeddings predicted from utterances by the [same speaker] are closer than embeddings computed from [different speakers]. \n",
      " In addition, a cycle-consistency loss is used to ensure that the [synthesized speech] encodes to a similar embedding as the adaptation utterance. \n",
      " A similar [spectrogram encoder network], trained without a triplet loss, was shown to work for transferring target [prosody] to [synthesized speech]. \n",
      " In this paper we demonstrate that training a similar [encoder] to discriminate between speakers leads to reliable transfer of [speaker characteristics]. \n",
      " Our work is most similar to the [speaker encoding] models in, except that we utilize a network independently-trained for a [speaker verification] task on a [large dataset] of untranscribed [audio] from tens of thousands of speakers, using a state-of-the-art generalized [end-to-end loss]. \n",
      " incorporated a [similar speaker]-discriminative representation into their model, however all components were trained jointly. \n",
      " In contrast, we explore transfer learning from a pre-trained [speaker verification] model. \n",
      " Doddipatla et al. used a similar transfer learning configuration where a [speaker embedding] computed from a pre-trained [speaker classifier] was used to condition a [TTS system]. \n",
      " In this paper we utilize an [end-to-end synthesis network] which does not rely on intermediate [linguistic features], and a substantially [different speaker] embedding network which is not limited to a closed set of speakers. \n",
      " Furthermore, we analyze how quality varies with the number of speakers in the training set, and find that zero-shot transfer requires training on thousands of speakers, many more than were used in. \n",

      " Critical to good generalization is the use of a representation which captures the characteristics of [different speakers], and the ability to identify these characteristics using only a short adaptation signal, independent of its [phonetic] content and background noise. \n",
      " These requirements are satisfied using a speaker-discriminative model trained on a text-[independent speaker] verification task. \n",
      " We follow, which proposed a highly scalable and accurate [neural network framework] for [speaker verification]. \n",
      " The network maps a sequence of log-[mel spectrogram] frames computed from a [speech] utterance of arbitrary length, to a fixed-dimensional embedding [vector], known as d-[vector]. \n",
      " The network is trained to optimize a generalized [end-to-end speaker verification] loss, so that embeddings of utterances from the [same speaker] have high cosine similarity, while those of utterances from [different speakers] are far apart in the embedding space. \n",
      " The [training dataset] consists of [speech audio] examples segmented into 1.6 seconds and [associated speaker] identity [labels] ; no transcripts are used. \n",
      " Input 40-channel log-[mel spectrograms] are passed to a network consisting of a stack of 3 [LSTM layers] of 768 cells, each followed by a projection to 256 dimensions. \n",

      " During inference, an arbitrary length utterance is broken into 800ms windows, overlapped by 50 %. \n",
      " The network is run independently on each window, and the outputs are averaged and normalized to create the final utterance embedding. \n",
      " Although the network is not optimized directly to learn a representation which captures [speaker characteristics] relevant to synthesis, we find that training on a [speaker discrimination] task leads to an embedding which is directly suitable for conditioning the synthesis network on [speaker identity]. \n",

      " In contrast to, we find that simply passing embeddings to the [attention layer], as in Figure 1, converges across [different speakers]. \n",

      " At the input, we map the text to a [sequence of phonemes], which leads to faster convergence and improved pronunciation of rare words and proper nouns. \n",
      " The network is trained in a transfer learning configuration, using a pretrained [speaker encoder] (whose parameters are frozen) to extract a speaker embedding from the target [audio], i.e. the [speaker reference] signal is the same as the target [speech] during training. \n",

      " [LibriSpeech] consists of the union of the two â clean â training sets, comprising 436 hours of [speech] from 1,172 speakers, sampled at 16 kHz. \n",
      " The majority of [speech] is US English, however since it is sourced from [audio] books, the tone and style of [speech] can differ significantly between utterances from the [same speaker]. \n",
      " We resegmented the data into shorter utterances by force aligning the [audio] to the transcript using an [ASR model] and breaking segments on silence, reducing the median duration from 14 to 5 seconds. \n",
      " As in the [original dataset], there is no punctuation in transcripts. \n",
      " The [speaker sets] are completely disjoint among the train, validation, and test sets. \n",
      " Many recordings in the [LibriSpeech clean corpus] contain noticeable environmental and stationary background noise. \n",
      " We preprocessed the [target spectrogram] using a simple [spectral] subtraction denoising procedure, where the background noise [spectrum] of an utterance was estimated as the 10th percentile of the energy in each frequency band across the full signal. \n",
      " This process was only used on the synthesis target ; the original noisy [speech] was passed to the [speaker encoder]. \n",
      " We trained separate synthesis and [vocoder networks] for each of these two corpora. \n",
      " Throughout this section, we used synthesis networks trained on [phoneme] inputs, in order to control for pronunciation in subjective evaluations. \n",

      " We used 11 seen and [unseen speakers] for VCTK and 10 seen and [unseen speakers] for [LibriSpeech] (Appendix D). \n",
      " For each speaker, we randomly chose one utterance with duration of about 5 seconds to use to compute the [speaker embedding] (see Appendix C). \n",
      " Each phrase was synthesized for each speaker, for a total of about 1,000 synthesized utterances [per] evaluation. \n",
      " Each sample was rated by a single rater, and each evaluation was conducted independently : the outputs of different models were not compared directly. \n",
      " Results are shown in Table 1, comparing the proposed model to baseline multispeaker models that utilize a lookup table of [speaker embeddings] similar to, but otherwise have identical architectures to the proposed [synthesizer network]. \n",

      " This is the consequence of two drawbacks of the [LibriSpeech dataset] : (i) the lack of punctuation in transcripts, which makes it difficult for the model to learn to pause naturally, and (ii) the higher level of background noise compared to VCTK, some of which the synthesizer has learned to reproduce, despite denoising the training targets as described above. \n",
      " Most importantly, the [audio] generated by our model for [unseen speakers] is deemed to be at least as natural as that generated for seen speakers. \n",
      " Surprisingly, the [MOS] on [unseen speakers] is higher than that of seen speakers, by as much as 0.2 points on [LibriSpeech]. \n",

      " It is likely that the ability of the proposed model to generalize well across a wide variety of speakers is based on the quality of the representation learned by the [speaker encoder]. \n",
      " We therefore explored the effect of the [speaker encoder training] set on synthesis quality. \n",
      " We made use of three additional training sets : [LibriSpeech] Other, which contains 461 hours of [speech] from a set of 1,166 [speakers disjoint] from those in the clean subsets, [VoxCeleb], and VoxCeleb2 which contain 139000 utterances from 1,211 speakers, and 1.09 M utterances from 5,994 speakers, respectively. \n",
      " Table   compares the performance of the proposed model as a function of the number of speakers used to train the [speaker encoder]. \n",
      " This measures the importance of [speaker diversity] when training the [speaker encoder]. \n",
      " To avoid overfitting, the [speaker encoders] trained on [small datasets] (top two rows) use a smaller [network architecture] (256-dim [LSTM cells] with 64-dim projections) and output 64 [dimensional speaker] embeddings. \n",
      " We first evaluate the [speaker encoder] trained on [LibriSpeech] Clean and Other sets, each of which contain a similar number of speakers. \n",
      " In Clean, the [speaker encoder] and synthesizer are trained on the [same data], a baseline similar to the non-fine tuned [speaker encoder] from, except that it is trained discriminatively as in. \n",
      " This matched condition gives a slightly better naturalness and a similar similarity score. \n",
      " As the number of [training speakers] increases, both naturalness and similarity improve significantly. \n",
      " The objective EER results also improve alongside the subjective evaluations. \n",
      " These results have an important implication for multispeaker [TTS training]. \n",
      " The [data requirement] for the [speaker encoder] is much cheaper than full [TTS training] since no transcripts are necessary, and the [audio quality] can be lower than for [TTS training]. \n",
      " We have shown that it is possible to synthesize very natural [TTS] by combining a [speaker encoder network] trained on large amounts of [untranscribed data] with a [TTS network] trained on a smaller set of high [quality data]. \n",

      " [Fictitious speakers] \n",
      "\n",
      " Bypassing the [speaker encoder network] and conditioning the synthesizer on random points in the speaker embedding space results in [speech] from [fictitious speakers] which are not present in the train or test sets of either the synthesizer or the [speaker encoder]. \n",
      " This is demonstrated in Table, which compares 10 [such speakers], generated from uniformly sampled points on the surface of the unit hypersphere, to their nearest neighbors in the training sets of the component networks. \n",
      " SV-EERs are computed using the same setup as Section after enrolling [voices] of the 10 nearest neighbors. \n",
      " Even though these speakers are totally fictitious, the synthesizer and the [vocoder] are able to generate [audio] as natural as for seen or unseen [real speakers]. \n",
      " The low cosine similarity to the nearest neighbor training utterances and very high EER indicate that they are indeed distinct from the [training speakers]. \n",

      " Conclusion \n",
      "\n",
      " We present a [neural network-based system] for multispeaker [TTS synthesis]. \n",
      " The system combines an independently trained [speaker encoder network] with a [sequence-to-sequence TTS synthesis] network and [neural vocoder] based on [Tacotron] 2. \n",
      " By leveraging the knowledge learned by the [discriminative speaker encoder], the synthesizer is able to generate high quality [speech] not only for speakers seen during training, but also for speakers never seen before. \n",
      " Through evaluations based on a [speaker verification] system as well as subjective listening tests, we demonstrated that the [synthesized speech] is reasonably similar to real [speech] from the [target speakers], even on such [unseen speakers]. \n",
      " We ran experiments to analyze the impact of the amount of data used to train the different components, and found that, given [sufficient speaker] diversity in the synthesizer training set, [speaker transfer] quality could be significantly improved by increasing the amount of [speaker encoder training data]. \n",
      " Transfer learning is critical to achieving these results. \n",
      " By separating the training of the [speaker encoder] and the synthesizer, the system significantly lowers the requirements for multispeaker [TTS training data]. \n",
      " It requires neither [speaker identity labels] for the synthesizer [training data], nor high quality clean [speech] or transcripts for the [speaker encoder training data]. \n",
      " In addition, training the components independently significantly simplifies the training configuration of the [synthesizer network] compared to since it does not require additional triplet or contrastive losses. \n",
      " However, modeling [speaker variation] using a low dimensional [vector] limits the ability to leverage large amounts of reference [speech]. \n",
      " Improving [speaker similarity] given more than a few seconds of reference [speech] requires a model adaptation approach as in, and more recently in. \n",
      " Finally, we demonstrate that the model is able to generate realistic [speech] from [fictitious speakers] that are dissimilar from the training set, implying that the model has learned to utilize a realistic representation of the space of [speaker variation]. \n",
      " The proposed model does not attain [human-level naturalness], despite the use of a [WaveNet vocoder] (along with its very high inference cost), in contrast to the [single speaker] results from. \n",
      " This is a consequence of the additional difficulty of generating [speech] for a variety of speakers given significantly [less data per] speaker, as well as the use of datasets with [lower data] quality. \n",
      " An additional limitation lies in the modelâs inability to transfer accents. \n",
      " Given sufficient [training data], this could be addressed by conditioning the synthesizer on [independent speaker] and accent embeddings. \n",
      " Finally, we note that the model is also not able to completely isolate the [speaker voice] from the [prosody] of the reference [audio], a similar trend to that observed in. \n",
