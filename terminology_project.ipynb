      "\n",
      " Abstract. \n",
      " In this paper, we describe recent work at Idiap Research Institute in the domain of [multilingual speech processing] and provide some insights into emerging challenges for the [research community]. \n",
      " [Multilingual speech processing] has been a topic of ongoing interest to the [research community] for many years and the field is now receiving renewed interest owing to two strong driving forces. \n",
      " Firstly, technical advances in [speech recognition] and synthesis are posing new challenges and opportunities to researchers. \n",
      " For example, [discriminative features] are seeing wide application by the [speech recognition] community, but additional issues arise when using [such features] in a [multilingual setting]. \n",
      " Another example is the apparent convergence of [speech recognition] and [speech synthesis] technologies in the form of statistical parametric methodologies. \n",
      " This convergence enables the investigation of new approaches to unified modelling for [automatic speech recognition] and [text-to-speech synthesis] ([TTS]) as well as [cross-lingual speaker adaptation] for [TTS]. \n",
      " The second driving force is the impetus being provided by both government and industry for technologies to help break down domestic and [international language] barriers, these also being barriers to the expansion of policy and commerce. \n",
      " [Speech-to-speech] and [speech-to]-text translation are thus emerging as key technologies at the heart of which lies [multilingual speech processing]. \n",
      "\n",
      " Keywords. [Multilingual speech processing] ; [speech synthesis] ; [speech recognition] ; [speech-to-speech translation] ; [language identification]. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Introduction \n",
      "\n",
      " [Multilingual speech processing] ([MLSP]) is a distinct field of research in [speech and language technology] that combines many of the techniques developed for monolingual systems with new approaches that address specific challenges of the multilingual domain. \n",
      " Research in [MLSP] should be of particular interest to countries such as India and Switzerland where there are several officially recognized languages and many more [additional languages] are commonly spoken. \n",
      " In such multilingual environments, the [language barrier] can pose significant difficulties in both commerce and government administration and technological advances that could help break down this barrier would be of great cultural and economic value. \n",
      " In this paper, we discuss current trends in [MLSP] and how these relate to advances in the general domain of [speech and language technology]. \n",
      " Examples of current advances and trends in the field of [MLSP] are provided in the form of case studies of research being conducted at Idiap Research Institute in the framework of international and national research programmes. \n",
      " The first case study presents work in personalized [speech-to-speech translation], in which we have made significant advances in developing methods for unsupervised [cross-lingual adaptation] of [hidden Markov model] (HMM)-based [speech synthesis]. \n",
      " In addition, this work has been closely linked with efforts to develop unified models for [automatic speech recognition] ([ASR]) and [text-to-speech synthesis] ([TTS]), thus highlighting the potential of [MLSP] to impact broader research topics. \n",
      " The second case study looks at discriminative methods in [ASR] and how these have been applied to problems in [MLSP]. \n",
      " This includes a study of [multilingual acoustic models], in particular in the context of multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based [discriminative feature] extraction. \n",
      " The major component of this study is the use of hierarchical classification frameworks that have the potential to provide more robust performance while simplifying means to perform crosslanguage knowledge transfer. \n",
      " The third and final case study looks at the related tasks of [language identification] and out-of-[language detection] using [ASR]. \n",
      " The paper is organized as follows : in section, we present a brief literature review of [multilingual speech processing], followed by a study of more recent trends in [speech and language technology] and how these impact [MLSP] in section. \n",
      " In sections, we present the three case studies on work being conducted at Idiap on personalized [speech-to-speech translation], [discriminative features] in [multilingual ASR], and [language identification] and out-of-[language detection], respectively. \n",
      " Finally, in section we provide some insights into future opportunities and challenges in [MLSP]. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Multilingual speech processing] \n",
      "\n",
      " In language, there are normally two forms of communication, namely, spoken form and written form. \n",
      " Depending upon the granularity of representation, both these forms can have different or common representation in terms of basic units. \n",
      " For instance, in spoken form, [phonemes] / syllables can be considered as the basic unit. \n",
      " Similarly, in the case of (most) written forms, [graphemes] / characters are the smallest basic units. \n",
      " However, above the smaller units, a word can be seen as a common unit for both spoken and written forms. \n",
      " The word then in turn can be described in terms of the smaller basic units corresponding to the spoken form or written form. \n",
      " For a given language, there can be a consistent relationship between spoken form and written form. \n",
      " However, the relationship may not be same across languages. \n",
      " Addressing the issue of a common basic representation across languages is central to [MLSP], although this can raise different challenges in applications such as [ASR] and [TTS]. \n",
      " It is important to note that not all languages spoken in the world have both forms. \n",
      " There are languages that have spoken   form but no written form. \n",
      " It should be noted that in case of some languages, the written form of word and the character representation may be   considered same ; e.g. [Mandarin language]. \n",
      " Most commonly, the idea of a unified [phonetic] lexicon is often used as the binding element in [MLSP systems]. \n",
      " Such a lexicon is available in the International [Phonetic] Association (IPA) system. \n",
      " Most [phonetic] lexicons are in practice just alternative parameterizations of the IPA symbols. \n",
      " Some IPA symbols are difficult to represent in computers, and are catered to by using the SAMPA3 and SAMPROSA4 systems. \n",
      " Although [SAMPA] was originally designed for just [European languages], it has occasionally been extended to others (e.g., Chinese). \n",
      " The worldbet system described in is more thorough. \n",
      " There is a one-to-one mapping between, say, ARPABET5 symbols and IPA symbols ; notation aside, the former is just a subset of the latter. \n",
      " A drawback of such a common representation is that it can preclude the possibility of tuning aspects of systems to the [particular language]. \n",
      " For instance, the C â V syllable structure of Japanese and tonal nature of Chinese would normally be hardwired in a monolingual system, but this may not be feasible in the multilingual case. \n",
      " In the remainder of this section, we give a brief survey of [MLSP] in the context of specific applications, concentrating on [ASR] and [TTS]. \n",

      "\n",
      " In the field of [ASR], advances have been largely promoted by the US government via the National Institute of Science and Technology. \n",
      " Besides running evaluations, one of the the main contributions of this has been to provide databases. \n",
      " This has led naturally to an [English language] focus for [ASR research] and development. \n",
      " That is not to say that [ASR research] is English centric ; rather, many of the algorithmic advances have been made initially in that language. \n",
      " Such advances have, however, translated easily to [different languages], largely owing to the robustness of [statistical approaches] to the different specificities of languages. \n",
      " State-of-the-art [ASR systems] are stochastic in nature and are typically based on HMM. \n",
      " Figure   illustrates a typical [HMM-based ASR system] for [English language]. \n",
      " From a [spoken language] perspective, the different components of the [HMM-based ASR system] are as follows. \n",
      " (i) [Feature extractor] that extracts the relevant information from the [speech signal] yielding a sequence of [feature observations] / [vectors]. \n",
      " [Feature extraction] is typically considered a language independent process (i.e., [common feature] extraction algorithms are used in most systems regardless of language), although in some cases (such as [tonal languages]) specific processing should be explored. \n",
      " (ii) [Acoustic model] that models the relation between the [feature vector] and units of spoken form (sound units such as phones). \n",
      " (iii) Lexicon that integrates lexical constraints on top of spoken unit level representation yielding a unit representation that is typically common to both spoken form and written form such as, word or [morpheme]. \n",
      " (iv) [Language model] that tends to model syntactical / grammatical constraints of the [spoken language] using the unit representation resulting after integrating lexical constraints. \n",

      " The [HMM-based ASR system] using Gaussians to model the [feature observations] is referred to as HMM / GMM system. \n",
      " Similarly, hybrid HMM / ANN systems refer to the case where artificial [neural networks] (ANNs), typically, [MLPs], are used to model the [feature observations] and estimate phone posteriors based on the [input features] within some temporal context (typically 90 ms). \n",
      " In [ASR], we are generally attempting to address one of two issues in [MLSP]. \n",
      " The first issue is that of building [multilingual models] ; that is, models that can recognize [speech] of [multiple languages]. \n",
      " In building such [multilingual systems], a major issue is the availability of resources. \n",
      " At present, there are various resources that enable multilingual [speech research]. \n",
      " An early example is the OGI multi [- language] telephone [speech corpus]. \n",
      " More recent ones are [GlobalPhone], SpeechDat(M) and SPEECON. \n",
      " Complementary to the issue of [data resources], the second major area of research in [MLSP] for [ASR] concerns [cross-language transfer]. \n",
      " Specifically, how [data resources] for a given language(s) can be used to improve [ASR] in another language, in particular when resources for that language are lacking. \n",
      " Much of the work in [cross-language transfer] has built upon progress already made in multilingual modelling. \n",
      " A trivial approach to building [multilingual models] is to construct separate acoustic and [language models] for each desired language, i.e., a monolingual system for each language. \n",
      " During recognition, multiple [decoders] corresponding to the different monolingual systems are run in parallel, and the recognizer output yielding the [maximum likelihood] is selected. \n",
      " As a by-product, the identity of language is also inferred. \n",
      " Such an approach is simple and feasible. \n",
      " However, in the light of practical issues such as portability to [new languages] (especially with fewer resources), system memory and computational requirements, it may not be the best approach. \n",
      " Given this, there has been considerable effort devoted to build [acoustic models] and [language models] that are shared across languages. \n",
      " Along the direction of multilingual acoustic modelling, the emphasis has been towards finding a common sound unit representation that is shared across languages. \n",
      " In the literature, a popular approach towards this is the creation of a â universal / globalâ phone set by first pooling the phone sets of [different languages] together and then merging them (i) based on heuristics / knowledge such as IPA-based (KÃ¶hler 1996) or [SAMPA-based] (Ackermann et al 1996), [articulatory features], (ii) in a data-driven manner by clustering (KÃ¶hler 1999) or by measuring [phoneme] similarity such as using confusion matrix (Andersen et al 1993), or (iii) both i.e., knowledge-based merging followed by datadriven clustering (Schultz & Waibel 1998 ; KÃ¶hler 1999). \n",
      " The underlying assumption here is that the articulatory representations of phones are similar across languages, and thus their acoustic realizations can be considered language independent. \n",
      " These studies were mostly done in the framework of modelling context-independent phones. \n",
      " The approach of knowledge-based merging followed by data-driven clustering for [context-dependent phone models] was further investigated by. \n",
      " In the literature, different studies have been reported for [cross-language transfer], where an [acoustic model] trained on a [different language] or many [different languages] (excluding [target language]) is (i) used directly when no data from the [target language] is available, (ii) adapted when [limited data] from [target language] is available, or (iii) used as seed model and then trained with large amount of data. \n",
      " When compared to the use of monolingual [acoustic models], it has been typically observed that [multilingual acoustic models] yield a better starting point for such [cross-language transfer]. \n",
      " From the above brief literature overview, it is clear that there has been reasonable success in constructing [multilingual acoustic models]. \n",
      " However, developing [multilingual language models] is still an open issue. \n",
      " Standard [ASR systems] typically use [N-gram language models], where word sequences are modelled by a N th order Markov chain, i.e., the model consists of probability to transit to a word given a word sequence of length N8. \n",
      " When estimating [N-gram language models] for [different languages], the [language-specific characteristic] plays a greater role. \n",
      " For instance, at the word level, the perplexity of the language can vary greatly depending on the degree of morphological inflection. \n",
      " As a result, morphologically [rich languages] can have many more words, thus leading to morphological-level rather than word-level representations. \n",
      " Also, some morphologically [rich languages] tend to allow free word ordering, which is clearly not well handled by simple [N-gram models]. \n",
      " Additionally, character-based languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not explicitly identify word boundaries. \n",
      " In such cases, a system for word segmentation is necessary. \n",
      " In spite of all these [language-specific issues], there is need for [multilingual language models] to handle, for example, instances of â code switching9â. \n",
      " Research in the direction of building [multilingual language models] has mainly focussed on (i) estimation of a [single language] model using the data from all languages, or (ii) estimation of a [language model] for each language separately including the words from [other languages] and interpolation of these. \n",
      " It has been observed that the latter approach yields better performance than the first approach. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Text-to-speech synthesis] \n",
      "\n",
      " In the domain of [TTS], issues in [multilingual speech processing] have been dominated by two main areas. \n",
      " This is partially due to the limitations of the dominant unit selection paradigm, which directly uses the recordings from [voice] talents in the generation of [synthesized speech]. \n",
      " It is clear that multilingual techniques in unit selection are thus bound by the limited availability of multilingual [voice] talents and more so by the availability of such recordings to the [research community], although some research has been conducted to overcome this. \n",
      " The first area concerns the construction of [TTS voices] in [multiple languages], which is dealt with in detail by. \n",
      " This area of research is largely concerned with the development of methodologies that can be made portable across languages, and include issues in text parsing, intonation and [waveform] generation. \n",
      " Many of these general issues are mirrored in challenges faced by the [multilingual ASR] community, as has been discussed in the opening of this section, although many of the related challenges are arguably more complex in [TTS] due to the extensive use of supra-[segmental features] and the greater degree of [language dependence] of [such features] â there is no â international prosodic alphabetâ. \n",
      " Much progress in this direction has been made owing to efforts of the [research community] towards the development of freely available corpora and [TTS tools] (for example, see Festival, Festvox and MBROLA), which has enabled the development of synthesis systems in [many languages]. \n",
      " Although, the systems that have been developed using these resources have remained largely independent of one another, these developments have laid the ground work for future multilingual applications of [TTS]. \n",
      " A second area of research that has a more evident emphasis on multilingual capabilities is that of polyglot synthesis. \n",
      " In polyglot synthesis, the goal is the synthesis of [mixed language] utterances, hence, a major challenge is in proper text parsing that enables correct pronunciation and intonation of such [speech]. \n",
      " Given appropriate text parsing, the main concern of [unit selection synthesis] is the efficient design of a mixed-[language inventory] of [speech]. \n",
      " A related field of research, [voice conversion], has helped overcome some of the limitations of unit selection methods with respect to [MLSP]. \n",
      " In particular, the application of [voice conversion] to cross-lignual scenarios has been investigated, especially in the context of [speech-to-speech translation]. Drawbacks of [voice conversion] techniques lie in their limited ability to modify supra-segmental [speech] characteristics and the requirement of [parallel data] for learning the conversion, although some progress in this direction has been made. \n",
      "\n",
      " refers to unigram, bigram, trigram, respectively. \n",
      " Code switching refers to the case where the user switches from one language to another language. \n",
      " The switch can happen within an utterance or across utterances. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Automatic language] recognition \n",
      "\n",
      " The objective of [automatic language] recognition is to recognize the [spoken language] by automatic analysis of [speech data]. \n",
      " [Automatic language] recognition can be classified into two tasks (i) [automatic language identification] and (ii) [automatic language] detection. \n",
      " In principle, this classification is similar to [speaker identification] and [speaker verification] in [speaker recognition] research. \n",
      " The goal of [automatic language identification] (LID) is to classify a given input [speech] utterance as belonging to one out of [L languages]. \n",
      " Various possible applications of LID can be found in [multilingual speech processing], call routing, interactive [voice] response applications, and [front-end processing] for [speech translation translation]. \n",
      " There are a variety of cues, including [phonological], morphological, syntactical or prosodic cues, that can be exploited by an LID system. \n",
      " In the literature, different approaches have been proposed to perform LID, such as using only low-level [spectral] information, using [phoneme recognizers] in conjunction with [phonotactic constraints] or using mediumto high-level information (e.g. lexical constraints, [language models]) through [speech recognition]. \n",
      " Among these, the most common approach is to use [phoneme recognizers] along with [phonotactic constraints]. \n",
      " The [phoneme recognizer] can be [language-dependent] (using a [language-specific phoneme set]) or [language-independent]   (using a multilingual [phoneme] set). \n",
      " The [phonotactic constraints] are typically modelled by a [phoneme] bigram estimated on phonetically [labelled] data. \n",
      " Given a segment of [speech signal] and associated claimed language, the goal of [automatic language] detection is to verify the claim or, in other words, choose one of the two possible hypotheses. \n",
      " A null hypothesis that the given [speech] segment belongs to the claimed language or the alternative hypothesis that the given segment does not belong to the claimed language. \n",
      " Usually, this is achieved by training a model corresponding to the null hypothesis using data from the [target language], and a separate model corresponding to the alternate hypothesis using data from [different languages]. \n",
      "\n",
      " Recent trends in [speech] and [language processing] \n",
      "\n",
      " We can identify a number of advances in [speech] and [language processing] that have significantly impacted [MLSP]. \n",
      " One of the most important developments has been the rise of statistical [machine translation] that has resulted in substantial funding and, consequently, research activity being directed towards [machine translation] and its related multilingual applications ([speech-to-speech], [speech-to]-text translation, etc.). \n",
      " Several notable projects have been pursued in recent years, to mention only a few : [Spoken Language] Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC DARPA initiative), Technology and Corpora for [Speech] to [Speech Translation] (TC-STAR FP6 European project), and the Global [Autonomous Language] Exploitation ([GALE] DARPA initiative10). \n",
      " Research in these projects not only needs to focus on the optimization of individual components, but also on how the components can be integrated together effectively to provide overall improved output. \n",
      " This is not a trivial task. \n",
      " For instance, [speech recognition systems] are typically optimized to reduce [word error rate] ([WER]) (or character / letter error rate, CER / LER, in some languages). \n",
      " The [WER] measure gives equal importance to the different types of error that can be committed by the [ASR system], namely, deletion, insertion and substitution. \n",
      " Suppose, if the [ASR system] output (i.e., text transcript) is processed by a [machine translation system], then deletion error is probably more expensive compared to other two errors as all information is lost. \n",
      " It then follows that the optimal performance with respect to [WER] may not provide the best possible translated output and vice versa. \n",
      " Indeed, in the [GALE] project (in the context of translation of [Mandarin language speech data] to English), it was observed that CER is less correlated with translation error rate when compared to objective functions such as SParseval (parsing-based word string scoring function). \n",
      " Similarly, the relatively recent emergence of [statistical parametric speech synthesis]   has resulted in a flurry of new research activities and is contributing to substantial efforts to â cross-pollinateâ ideas between [ASR] and [TTS], as techniques in these two fields have become increasingly interrelated. \n",
      " [HMM-based TTS] has helped accelerate efforts in the development of [multilingual TTS] by providing a means to easily train synthesis systems for [new languages], where adaptive techniques may prove particularly useful. \n",
      " It is also evident that the dominant source-filter model employed in [HMM-based TTS]   may not be   ideal for all languages and further work is being carried out to address this problem. \n",
      " There has also been increasing effort in the use of lightly supervised and unsupervised training methods for [ASR], which has more recently been applied to [TTS]. \n",
      " Methods that use â foundâ data from the internet have also been shown to be useful. \n",
      " Such approaches have the potential to have a great impact on efforts in [MLSP] for poorer resourced languages or languages with little transcribed material, as has been demonstrated by. \n",
      " There have also been efforts in [cross-lingual language modelling], where [cross-lingual information retrieval] and [machine translation] have been used with (i) sentence-aligned [parallel corpus], (ii) document-aligned corpus, and (iii) latent semantic analysis to improve language modelling for resource-[deficient language]. \n",
      " Finally, relatively recent efforts have been introduced to integrate more appropriate training criteria in machine learning algorithms that provide more discriminative models in the case of [ASR] and better quality synthesis for [TTS]. \n",
      " This has not only been restricted to the estimation of model parameters, but has also been applied to [feature extraction], such as [MLP] features. \n",
      " These methods have been shown to provide significant improvements for monolingual [ASR systems], but generalization to the multilingual case has not been extensively investigated. \n",
      " There are different ways for improvement of these methods, such as use of hierarchical methods based on [MLP] or [conditional random fields], [MLP] regularization approach to handle resource (data) differences across languages through [cross-language transfer]. \n",

      "\n",
      " One aspect which we take for granted in spoken communication that is largely missing from current [speech-to-speech translation] (SST) technology is a means to facilitate the personal nature of spoken dialogue. \n",
      " That is, state-of-the-art approaches lack or are limited in their ability to be personalized in an effective and unobtrusive manner, thereby acting as a barrier to natural communication. \n",
      " The use of a common framework for [ASR] and [TTS] provides several interesting research opportunities in the framework of SST, including the development of unified approaches for the modelling of [speech] for recognition and synthesis that will need to adapt across languages to each userâs speaking characteristics. \n",
      " In this section, we present progress that has recently been made by Idiap in the EMIME project, but firstly, we discuss the role of translation in our study. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Machine translation] as the glue \n",
      "\n",
      " Unlike in most other [speech-to-speech translation] projects, translation plays a less prominent role in EMIME. \n",
      " The key focus of research is the personalization of SST, which essentially requires the development of techniques for unsupervised [cross-lingual speaker adaptation] for [HMM-based TTS]. \n",
      " Translation acts as the â glueâ that links the input and [output languages] for [cross-lingual adaptation] and also links [ASR] and [TTS] for unsupervised adaptation. \n",
      " Thus, we can consider our goal as comprising two main tasks :   \n",
      " â¢ To bridge the gap between [ASR] and [TTS] by investigating techniques in unsupervised adaptation for [TTS]. \n",
      " â¢ To bridge the gap between languages such that we can perform [cross-lingual adaptation] of [HMM-based TTS]. \n",
      " We are working with [several languages] that encompass a range of [language families], geographical regions and partner competencies : English, Finnish, Japanese and Mandarin. \n",
      " English always comprises one of the languages in each [SST language] pair. \n",
      " At Idiap, our research has primarily focused on the English â [Mandarin language] pair. \n",
      " English â Mandarin is arguably the most disparate of the [language pairs] under consideration. \n",
      " Although, this poses a greater challenge, it may better enable us to ascertain and analyse differences between the different approaches under investigation. \n",
      " In performing unsupervised [cross-lingual speaker adaptation] within a [speech-to-speech translation framework], we consider two possible approaches : a â pipelineâ framework, in which individual components operate largely independent of one another ; and a â unifiedâ framework in which [ASR] and [TTS] modules share common components such as [feature extraction] and acoustic   models. \n",
      " It should be clear that, while the pipeline framework contains a great deal of redundancy, it allows each component to be separately optimized, whereas the unified framework minimizes redundancy, but possibly at a cost to performance. \n",

      " [Statistical parametric approaches] have emerged in recent years as a dominant paradigm for [TTS]. \n",
      " Training of such models is very similar to the training of models for [ASR] â [acoustic features] are first generated that are used to train [acoustic models] given corresponding [labels]. \n",
      " During synthesis, the [label sequence] is generated from the text to be synthesized. \n",
      " The [acoustic model] is then used to generate the maximum a posteriori probability observation sequence for the given [labels], taking into account the explicit relationship between dynamic and static components of the [feature vector] (Zen et al 2009). \n",
      " This can be considered the inverse of the inference procedure carried out in [ASR]. \n",
      " Other major differences between [ASR] and [TTS] include 14 the following    \n",
      " â¢ [Acoustic features] : should provide necessary information to reconstruct the [speech signal], normally including [pitch] and excitation information    \n",
      " â¢ [Labels] : take into account a much broader range of acoustic and prosodic contexts. \n",
      " Such â fullâ context [labels] are normally produced by first parsing text with a [TTS front-end] ; and    \n",
      " â¢ Models : normally differ from standard HMM by including explicit duration modelling (hidden semi-[Markov model] â HSMM) and provide appropriate distributions for modelling of [discontinuous features] such as [pitch] (multi-space probability distribution â MSD (Tokuda et al 2002)). \n",
      " To perform [unsupervised speaker] adaptation of [TTS], we use [ASR] to generate transcriptions that are necessary to adapt the [TTS models]. \n",
      " In the pipeline approach, [ASR transcriptions] form the only link between the [ASR] and [TTS] modules. \n",
      " These erroneous [ASR transcriptions] are then fed through a [TTS front-end] that is used to generate the â full-contextâ [labels] for the adaptation of the [TTS models]. \n",
      " In the unified approach, [acoustic models] and features also link the two and adaptation of [TTS] is carried out implicitly during the adaptation of the [ASR models] without the need for a [TTS front-end]. \n",
      " As noted previously, paradigms for [ASR] and [TTS] have undergone a degree of convergence in recent years and now the [HMM-based approach] is commonly employed for both. \n",
      " As part of our initial studies, we conducted a comparison of [feature extraction], acoustic modelling and adaptation for [ASR] and [TTS]. \n",
      " Although fully unified [ASR] and [TTS models] may be sub-optimal, our goal was to quantify the differences between the two that would enable us to better determine where and by how much these approaches differ. \n",
      " We did this by taking [ASR] and [TTS] baselines built on a [common corpus] and then systematically interchanged [ASR] and [TTS] components related to lexicon and phone set, [feature extraction], model topology and [speaker adaptation]. \n",
      " Our findings showed that many of the techniques used in [ASR] and [TTS] can not be simply applied to [TTS] and [ASR], respectively without negative consequences. \n",
      " Despite this, we are still interested in unified modelling â not necessarily as a means to explicitly model [speech] jointly for both [ASR] and [TTS], but rather as a means to transfer knowledge and approaches between the two. \n",
      " We present two examples of this study which relate to [feature extraction] and acoustic modelling. \n",
      " [Voice] tract length normalization for [speech synthesis] Vocal tract length normalization ([VTLN]) is a [feature transformation] technique that has been used extensively in [speech recognition] to provide robust and [rapid speaker] adaptation. \n",
      " [VTLN] operates on the principle that the vocal tract length varies across [different speakers] and the formant frequency   positions are inversely proportional to this. \n",
      " Thus, by warping the frequency scale during [feature extraction] we are able to approximately account for this variability across listeners. \n",
      " An additional advantage of using [VTLN] in the context of [cross-lingual adaptation] is that it should be inherently independent of the language being spoken. \n",
      " Building upon earlier studies in [ASR], we have been investigating the use of [VTLN] in [statistical parametric speech synthesis]. \n",
      " In the context of speaker adaptive [speech synthesis], the most commonly employed [feature extraction] technique is the [mel]-generalized cepstrum (MGCEP). \n",
      " MGCEP analysis uses a bilinear transform to achieve [spectral] warping that can approximate that of the [mel] auditory scale (see figure). \n",
      " The bilinear transform has also been used to perform [VTLN]   and it follows that a cascade of bilinear transforms simply gives another bilinear transform. \n",
      " Hence, [VTLN] can be made implicit to MGCEP analysis and can further be formulated as a linear transform in the cepstral domain, which permits optimization via grid-search or expectation-maximization. \n",
      " We have shown that [VTLN] for [TTS] carries with it additional challenges. \n",
      " Firstly, the highdimensional nature of [TTS features] results in more severe impact of warping on the [feature space], not only making the use of Jacobian normalization imperative, but also requiring care with the initialization of the model. \n",
      " Secondly, it is not clear that the ideal criterion for [VTLN] in [TTS] is the same as that typically used in [ASR]. \n",
      " We have noted that the warping factors inferred using the usual objective function do not result in perceptible warping of the [voice], while a modified criterion achieves warping that is subjectively closer to the [target speaker] (but, in contrast, is detrimental to [ASR performance]). \n",
      " This result suggests, once again, the divergent nature of [ASR] and [TTS] in terms of direct compatibility, but demonstrates the portability of fundamental techniques between the two. \n",
      " [Decision tree] marginalization In [unsupervised adaptation of TTS], we adapt [synthesis models] from the noisy [speech recognition output]. \n",
      " If we wish to bypass the [TTS front-end], this requires a means to adapt the full-context [TTS acoustic models] from the [triphone-context labels] generated by the [ASR]. \n",
      " Several approaches have been proposed to achieve this end, including a method that transfers regression class trees from triphone models to full-context models   and approaches that consider triphone and full-context models using a shared set of parameters. \n",
      " We have proposed the [decision tree] marginalization approach that takes a standard set of fullcontext models trained for [TTS] and marginalizes out the contexts irrelevant to [ASR] (e.g., leaving triphone only contexts) (see figure). \n",
      " The marginalized models can then be used to estimate adaptation transforms from [ASR transcriptions] or can be used to directly perform the [ASR], although at a cost to performance. \n",
      " We have shown that such models can be used in [unsupervised adaptation of TTS] with minimal impact on synthesis quality compared to supervised adaptation using the full-context models. \n",

      " Bridging the gap between languages \n",
      "\n",
      " Another aspect of the EMIME project concerns the adaptation of [speaker identity] across languages for [HMM-based TTS]. \n",
      " As discussed earlier, multi-linguality for [TTS] has previously been mostly concerned with polyglot synthesis. \n",
      " Likewise, [ASR] multilingual modelling has been mostly concerned with building [acoustic models] that can recognize [multiple languages] or with [cross-language transfer] in mind. \n",
      " Thus, [cross-lingual speaker adaptation] constitutes something of a new task. \n",
      " We define the [input language] as the language in which [speech] input is provided to the SST system and the [output language] as the language in which spoken output is generated by the SST system. \n",
      " To date, the main approaches that have been considered involve a mapping from models / states in the [input language] to models / states in the [output language]. \n",
      " The most successful approaches have involved state-mappings derived from KL-divergence (KLD) between models trained on input and [output language data]. \n",
      " The mappings can then be used to map either transforms or distributions between languages (see figure). \n",
      " â¢ In transform mapping, intralingual adaptation is carried out in the [input language]. \n",
      " Generated transforms are then mapped to the [output language acoustic models] by associating each HMM state distribution in the [output language acoustic model] with a state distribu     tion in the [input language acoustic model] according to the KLD criterion. \n",
      " Transforms are then transferred from the [input language] states to the [output language] states according to the defined mapping. \n",
      " â¢ In [data mapping], each state in the [input language acoustic model] is associated with a state from the [output language acoustic model] according to KLD criterion. \n",
      " [Output language] states are then substituted for [input language] states according to this mapping and intralingual adaptation is performed. \n",
      " The generated transforms may then be directly applied to the [output language acoustic model]. \n",
      " We have concentrated on studying these HMM state mapping techniques in both supervised and unsupervised adaptation (using [decision tree] marginalization) modes of operation. \n",
      " We also proposed an alternative stochastic mapping approach that uses [decision tree] marginalization on the [output language acoustic models] to marginalize out all contexts that are unique to the [output language acoustic model], such that the resulting [acoustic model] can be used directly on the [input language] (see figure). \n",
      " The results of this first study showed that unsupervised and supervised adaptation using [maximum likelihood] linear transformations (MLLT) gave similar performance as in the intralingual adaptation scenario. \n",
      " This was a good result as it demonstrated the robustness of adaptation algorithms vis-Ã -vis unsupervised and [cross-lingual scenarios]. \n",
      " We also showed that the language of the reference [speech] plays an important role in peopleâs ability to evaluate [speaker similarity], a topic which is now under investigation. \n",
      " Finally, of the different [cross-lingual adaptation approaches] that were investigated, it was apparent that those using the HMM state emission distributions of the [output language acoustic model] for transform estimation were preferred over the transform mapping approach. \n",
      " In light of this final observation, we performed further analysis to ascertain where the state mapping techniques may still be inferior to intralingual approaches specifically studying the influence of [language mismatch] during adaptation and synthesis. \n",
      " We analysed adaptation performance with respect to differing number of transforms and amount of [adaptation data], from which it became clear that [cross-lingual approaches] were not effectively able to benefit from the availability of larger quantities of [adaptation data]. \n",
      " In particular, the [aforementioned data] mapping approach was more susceptible to take on characteristics associated with the [input language] rather than [input speaker], resulting in increasingly distorted [synthesized speech] in the [output language] as the number of adaptation transforms was increased (see figure). \n",
      " This behaviour was attributed to the inherent mismatch between phones in the source and [target languages] and has made it clear that in order to further improve [cross-lingual adaptation], we will need to counter this mismatch during adaptation. \n",

This increase in distortion as the number of transforms increases is attributed to [language mismatch] between models and transforms. \n",

      " Summary \n",
      "\n",
      " We have presented work being conducted at Idiap as part of the EMIME [speech-to-speech translation] project. \n",
      " In this work we are not only having to deal with the challenges of multilingual modelling for [ASR] and [TTS], but are addressing more fundamental issues concerning unified modelling. \n",
      " Our results so far indicate that direct attempts at unified modelling do not necessarily present themselves as a realistic alternative to separate [ASR] and [TTS] modelling, but several promising directions have emerged when unified modelling has been considered as a means to port knowledge and approaches between [ASR] and [TTS]. \n",
      " Furthermore, our efforts towards unsupervised [cross-lingual adaptation] have shown that good results can be achieved by using largely conventional approaches. \n",
      "\n",
      " [MLP] features and [multilingual ASR] \n",
      "\n",
      " There have been shortcomings in the current approaches but efforts are underway to overcome these issues. \n",
      " There has been sustained interest in using [MLP]-based [discriminative features] for [automatic speech recognition] for several reasons. \n",
      " (i) Discriminative nature of the features  \n",
      " (ii) Ability of [MLP] to handle different types of features and long temporal context at the input. \n",
      " (iii) Robustness towards speaker   and environmental variation   (iv) Ability to combine [multiple feature] streams at [MLP output] level using probabilistic methods (v) Performance improvements obtained are scalable across different training criteria, as well as with amount of data. \n",
      " Figure   depicts a typical [MLP feature]-based [ASR system]. \n",
      " The main components of [MLP feature] extraction are (i) an [MLP] trained to classify [phonemes] / phones and (ii) Karhunen Loeve transformation (KLT) matrix (estimated on a data other than [test data]) to decorrelate the [feature vectors]. \n",
      " Optionally, during KLT dimensionality, reduction could be done. \n",
      " This helps in controlling the dimensionality of the [feature space], especially when the [MLP features] are concatenated with the standard [spectral features]. \n",
      " Traditionally, a HMM / GMM system models [acoustic features] that are extracted from shortterm [spectrum] (usually 20â30 ms) of [speech signal]. \n",
      " The extraction of these [acoustic features] is assumed to be [language-independent]. \n",
      " When compared to GMM-based modelling, [MLPs] have the capability to model higher [dimensional feature vector] (e.g., standard [spectral features] with temporal context). \n",
      " Furthermore, [MLPs] avoid the need to make assumption about parametric distribution of [input features]. \n",
      " As a result, the use of [MLP] features has led to exploration of spectro-temporal [acoustic features], i.e., features that span across and characterize both time and frequency. \n",
      " The time span or temporal context in this case can vary from about 250 ms to 1 s, which is about the duration of a syllable. \n",
      " In literature, in the context of [MLP feature], it has been found that a combination of spectro-[temporal feature] processing and conventional [spectral processing] can lead to a better [ASR system]. \n",
      " However, as the acoustic â [phonetic] relationship can differ across languages, one may ask if such spectro-temporal [speech processing] techniques can also be considered languageindependent. \n",
      " Along this line, we present [ASR] studies using hierarchical [MRASTA features] for two [different languages] in section. \n",
      " An interesting aspect of [MLP feature] extraction is that the [MLP] can be trained on the data that is different from the domain of the task, while still yielding good generalization performance. \n",
      " In the context of multilingual processing, this aspect can be effectively used by training the [MLP] on a language which has more resources (in terms of data), and using the [MLP] for languages that have fewer or no resources. \n",
      " This is similar to [cross-lingual transfer] using [acoustic models] (discussed earlier in section), except that [cross-lingual transfer] here is achieved at [feature extraction] level. \n",
      " Section   presents a study on [cross-lingual transfer] using [MLP] features. \n",
      " Similar to multilingual acoustic modelling, the [MLP] can be trained with data from [different languages] to classify a â universal / globalâ phone set. \n",
      " By sharing data from [different languages], such an approach not only helps in handling [data issues] related to [multilingual ASR], but could also help in extracting [MLP features] that yield a better [multilingual ASR system]. \n",

      " The [ASR] studies showed that [cross-lingual adaptation approach] often yields the best system even when compared to the case where the [MLP feature] is extracted using [monolingual MLP] (i.e., trained only on [Hungarian data]). \n",
      " Although, the studies on [cross-lingual MLP features] are limited, it has been typically found (including the study presented here) that using [MLPs] trained on a [different language] â directlyâ may not yield a system better than [MLP] trained on [target language data] (if available). \n",
      " In other words, to make better use of the [MLPs] trained on a [different language], [cross-lingual adaptation] or some kind of training on the [target language] may be necessary. \n",
      " The [cross-lingual adaptation approach] discussed earlier is one way this could be achieved. \n",
      " Another way would be to use the recently proposed hierarchical [MLP]-based phone posterior estimation approach, where two stages (hierarchy) of [MLPs] are trained to classify context-independent phones. \n",
      " In the first stage, the [input feature] to the [MLPs] is a standard [spectral]-based feature. \n",
      " The input to the second stage [MLP] is [phone posterior probabilities] estimated by the first stage [MLP] with temporal context of around 150â230 ms. \n",
      " This approach has been shown to yield better [phoneme recognition] performance as well as [ASR performance] than the single [MLP]-based approach. \n",
      " In the context of [cross-lingual adaptation], the first [MLP] can be trained on a resource rich language(s) and the second [MLP] can be trained on the [target language] with the [available data]. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Multilingual MLP features] \n",
      "\n",
      " [Cross-lingual MLP feature extraction] considers training the [MLP] on a [secondary language] that has more resources. \n",
      " In the context of [multilingual speech recognition], it is possible to consider an [MLP] trained to classify a universal / global phone set (instead of phone set belonging to a [particular language]) using data from [different languages]. \n",
      " Similar to the case of multilingual acoustic modelling, it can be expected that such an approach can help in sharing data from [different languages], and can also yield a compact and better [multilingual ASR system]. \n",
      " In this case, we refer to the [MLP] as a [multilingual MLP], and the resulting features as [multilingual MLP features]. \n",
      " In a preliminary study, we investigated the [multilingual MLP features] on five [European languages], namely, English, Italian, Spanish, Swiss French, and Swiss German from the SpeechDat(II) corpus (HÃ¶ge et al 1999). \n",
      " The data corresponding to the isolated / application words was used for this study. \n",
      " Table   shows the [data distribution] for [different languages]. \n",
      " We used the dictionary (based on the [SAMPA] phone set) provided along with the database. \n",
      " Table   shows the number of context-independent phones, and the number of application words (size of lexicon) for each language. \n",
      " We trained a [monolingual MLP] corresponding to each language classifying their respective context-independent phones. \n",
      " We adopted the knowledge-driven approach for universal phone set creation, i.e., the phone sets of all the five languages were pooled together and then merged based on their [SAMPA] symbols. \n",
      " This resulted in a universal phone set with 92 phones (including silence). \n",
      " A [multilingual MLP] with 39-dimensional [PLP cepstral features] and nine frames of temporal context as input was then trained to classify this universal phone set. \n",
      " We investigated the following systems for [MLP] features. \n",
      " (i) Mono-tandem : For each language, a separate [acoustic model] is built using [PLP cepstral features] concatenated with [MLP feature] extracted from their respective [monolingual MLP]. \n",
      " (ii) Multi-tandem : The [multilingual MLP] is used here as [feature extractor]. \n",
      " For each language, the KLT statistics was estimated using only the data specific to the language, and then while applying KLT the dimensionality was reduced to match the output dimension of the corresponding [monolingual MLP]. \n",
      " This dimensionality was reduced to make the system comparable to mono-tandem in terms of complexity. \n",
      " A separate [acoustic model] was then built for each language separately using the [PLP cepstral features] concatenated with the [multilingual MLP features]. \n",
      " (iii) [Shared-tandem] : Similarly to the multi-tandem system, we used the [multilingual MLP] for [MLP feature] extraction. \n",
      " However, in this system, data from all the languages was used for KLT statistics estimation, thus yielding a multlingual [MLP feature] different from multitandem system. \n",
      " In addition, we used the data from all the languages to train a common [acoustic model] that is shared across languages. \n",
      " In other words, both [MLP feature] extraction and acoustic modelling are [language-independent]. \n",
      " It should be noted that here again the [feature observation] for [acoustic model] consists of the [PLP cepstral features] concatenated with [multilingual MLP features]. \n",
      " We evaluated the above systems on two different tasks. \n",
      " (i) Mono-lingual task : In this case, it is assumed that the [language identity] is known a priori, and the [ASR system] corresponding to the language is used for decoding the test utterance. \n",
      " In other words, this task corresponds to [monolingual speech recognition]. \n",
      " (ii) [Mixed language] task : In this case, it is assumed that the [language identity] is not known a priori. \n",
      " While decoding the test utterance, all the five [ASR systems] are run in parallel and the output hypothesis yielding [maximum likelihood] is selected as the recognized output 17. \n",
      " In other words, this task corresponds to [multilingual speech recognition]. \n",
      " In the case of the [mixed language] task, it can be observed that mono-tandem and multi-tandem systems have different complexities, i.e., the dimensionality of the [feature vectors] is different across languages. \n",
      " To handle this, a recognizer dependent bias was subtracted from the respective [log likelihood] scores) before making a decision about the word hypothesis. \n",
      " The recognizer dependent bias was estimated on the development set. \n",
      " In table 5, we show the performances for the different systems and tasks. \n",
      " The performance of each system is expressed as the average word accuracy computed across the five languages. \n",
      " The results show that [multilingual MLP features] yield the best performance in terms of relative loss in performance between mono and mixed tasks. \n",
      " Although, the [shared-tandem system yields] slightly inferior performance compared to other systems on the mono task, it yields significantly better performance on the mixed task. \n",
      " A similar trend has been previously reported in the context of language independent acoustic modelling. \n",
      " In summary, the superiority of the [shared-tandem system] on the mixed task can be attributed to the combination of two factors : (i) sharing of data across languages which results in better [acoustic model], and (ii) use of [multilingual MLP features]. \n",

      " Summary \n",
      "\n",
      " In this section, we presented three studies on [multilingual ASR] using [MLP] features. \n",
      " In the first study, we investigated the [MRASTA] and hierarchical [MRASTA features] across two [different languages]. \n",
      " We found the trends to be similar across languages. \n",
      " The second study presented the use of [MLP features] for [cross-lingual transfer] (without any adaptation or retraining), where we found that it is possible to obtain improvements using [cross-lingual MLP features]. \n",
      " Finally, we presented a preliminary study on the use of [multilingual MLP features]. \n",
      " Our studies indicate that shared [multilingual MLP feature] extraction yields better performance when compared to [language-specific multilingual MLP feature] extraction or [monolingual MLP feature] extraction. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Language identification] / detection \n",
      "\n",
      " In section, we briefly described that [language identification] systems use different levels of abstraction related to [spoken language] processing, including the use of [phonotactic constraints], lexical constraints, or both lexical and [language constraints] through [ASR system]. \n",
      " Section   presents a preliminary study on hierarchical [MLP]-based LID system. \n",
      " This system tries to capture implicitly [phonotactic constraints] and acoustic confusions present at the output of a [multilingual MLP] to achieve [language identification]. \n",
      " Another way of framing the [language detection] (LD) problem is in terms of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) detection. \n",
      " Monolingual [automatic speech recognition systems] assume that the test utterances contain only words from the [target language]. \n",
      " However, it is possible that segments of test utterances can contain words from foreign language(s), especially in natural conversations. \n",
      " In section, we present an approach to detect such out-of-[language segments] using confidence measures. \n",
      "\n",
      " Hierarchical [MLP]-based [language identification] \n",
      "\n",
      " In section, we briefly described the recently proposed hierarchical [MLP]-based [phoneme] posterior estimation approach and discussed about the potential of applying it for [cross-lingual MLP feature extraction]. \n",
      " In, we have studied the role of the second [MLP layer] in such hierarchical arrangements using Volterra series and have found that it is predominantly responsible for learning [phonetic]-temporal patterns present in the [posterior features]. \n",
      " The learned [phonetic]-temporal patterns consist of acoustic confusions among [phonemes] and [phonotactic constraints] of the language. \n",
      "\n",
      " Table. Comparison of different LID systems. \n",
      " The System Hier performance was obtained with a temporal context of 290 ms at the input of the second stage [MLP]. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In the context of LID, such [phonetic]-temporal patterns could possibly be exploited by first training an [MLP] to classify the previously described universal [phoneme] set (multilingual [speech] units), and then modelling a larger temporal context of the resulting [posterior features] by a second [MLP] to classify languages. \n",
      " It can be expected that information related to [phonotactic]   constraints and acoustic confusion among [phonemes] (present in the [posterior features] spanning a long temporal context) is [language-specific]. \n",
      " We performed a preliminary study on hierarchical [MLP]-based LID system using the five [European language] setup and the [multilingual MLP] described earlier in section. \n",
      " The second stage [MLP] of the hierarchical [MLP]-based LID system was trained with the [posterior features] (universal [phone posterior probabilities]) estimated at the output of the [multilingual MLP]. \n",
      " The temporal context at the input of the second [MLP] was varied from 130â310 ms. \n",
      " During testing, the decision about the [language identity] was made by choosing the language that scores the highest log posterior probability over the whole test utterance. \n",
      " We refer to this system as Hier. \n",
      " We compared the hierarchical [MLP]-based LID system against two different reference systems. \n",
      " In both these systems, the [phone posterior probabilities] estimated at the output of the [multilingual MLP] are used as a local score. \n",
      " In the first system, the [language-specific phoneme recognizers] are run in parallel with their respective bigram [phonotactic language] model. \n",
      " The LID is achieved by selecting the [decoder output] that yields the [maximum likelihood]. \n",
      " This system is referred to as PC. \n",
      " In the second system, the [language identity] is inferred through [speech recognition]. \n",
      " The second system is similar to the [shared-tandem system] described earlier in section   where the [acoustic model] is shared across languages. \n",
      " However, the recognition is done by using hybrid HMM / [MLP]-based isolated word recognition system. \n",
      " This system is referred to as SR. \n",
      " Table 6 shows the performance (measured in terms of percentage accuracy) of the different LID systems investigated. \n",
      " In the case of System Hier, the performance is reported for the temporal context of 290 ms. \n",
      " For further details on the effect of temporal context, the reader is referred to. \n",
      " It can be seen that the hierarchical LID system, i.e., Hier system yields the best performance. \n",
      " When comparing the performance of SR and PC systems, the trend is similar to what has been previously reported in the literature. \n",
      " More specifically, higher LID performance has been typically reported (although for fewer number of [language classes]) using the large vocabulary continuous [speech recognition (LVCSR) system] when compared to [acoustic-phonotactic] based systems. \n",
      " Overall, the study shows that there is good potential in exploiting the hierarchial [MLP]-based approach for [language identification]. \n",
      "\n",
      " Out-of-[language detection] \n",
      "\n",
      " In [multilingual speech processing], the [speech data] can contain words from different / [multiple languages]. \n",
      " Earlier in section 2.1, we mentioned that in the context of [multilingual ASR] this can be possibly handled by the use of [multilingual language models]. \n",
      " In contrast, there are cases where the goal is to perform [monolingual speech recognition] but the [speech data] may contain words (or a sequence of words) from [foreign language]. \n",
      " For instance, it has been observed that   in spontaneous meeting recordings, the interchangeable use of [different languages] in short time periods by the [same speaker] can often be registered. \n",
      " The existence of such segments from [foreign language] can have an adverse effect on the performance of the [ASR system]. \n",
      " The adverse effect may be limited by the detection of out-of-language (OOL) segments. \n",
      " We have proposed a new approach to detect OOL segments through the use of wordand phone-based confidence measures. \n",
      " In principle, OOL detection can be compared to LD task. \n",
      " However, unlike the LD task, in our OOL detection approach no data from [other languages] is used. \n",
      " Instead, given a test utterance / segment the OOL detection is achieved by :   \n",
      " (i) Running [LVCSR system] of the [target language] to obtain phone lattices or word lattices. \n",
      " (ii) Treating the lattices as the model and estimating frame level [phone posterior probabilities] or word posterior probabilities by using standard forward â backward algorithm. \n",
      " (iii) Estimating a posterior-based confidence measure (CM) from the posterior probability estimate of either phones or words. \n",
      " This is followed by incorporation of temporal context via median filtering of the CM. \n",
      " (iv) Finally, using the posterior-based CM as threshold on the individual [speech] segments of the one-best hypothesis obtained from the [LVCSR system]. \n",
      " In our work, we have investigated different types of confidence measures and their combination using maximum entropy classifier. \n",
      " We evaluated the OOL detection technique on Klewel meeting recordings18. \n",
      " The [evaluation data] consists of 3 h of recordings each from three languages, namely, English, French and Italian, i.e., in total 9 h of recordings. \n",
      " English recordings represent in-[language speech] segments, while French and Italian recordings represent out-of-[language segments]. \n",
      " This data was processed by an English [LVCSR system] to obtain word and phone recognition lattices. \n",
      " Experiments on the detection of OOL segments (caused by the French and Italian recordings) yield performances of about 11 % EER. \n",
      " Subsequent incorporation of temporal context significantly increased the achieved performance. \n",
      " Median filter with a length of 3 s yield relative improvement of about 62 % with respect to the system without application of temporal context. \n",
      "\n",
      " Summary \n",
      "\n",
      " In this section, we first presented a LID system based on hierarchical [MLP]-based approach. \n",
      " Through preliminary studies, we demonstrated that this system could yield better performance than standard approaches, such as modelling [phonotactic constraints]. \n",
      " We next presented an outof-[language detection] approach using confidence measures similar to out-of-vocabulary word detection, and showed its application on real [word data]. \n",
      "\n",
      " Future opportunities and challenges \n",
      "\n",
      " We have presented an overview of [multilingual speech processing] â past progress and current trends â from the perspective of our own research activities at Idiap Research Institute. \n",
      " We   have shown that a prime mover behind current trends has been the rise of statistical [machine translation], which has had a ripple on effect on the general field of [MLSP]. \n",
      " It also should be apparent that future trends will still closely follow on from developments made in mainstream [speech and language technologies], but the distinct challenges of [MLSP] will also give rise to novel solutions. \n",
      " Similar to the influence of statistical [machine translation] on developments in [MLSP] in recent years, we anticipate future activity will be strongly driven by web-based services, especially those for mobile devices. \n",
      " We note that these services are becoming widely available and, combined with affordable broadband wireless access, such services will provide an opportunity to make available a broader range of capabilities to mobile devices, especially those based on computationally demanding tasks in [MLSP]. \n",
      " Thus, we are already seeing services being provided by major market players in the domain of [speech processing] and we can expect that will also expand to a greater number of applications in [MLSP] and consequently an increase in research and development activity in both academic and industry alike. \n",
      " In our own work, two primary research directions that have emerged are [cross-lingual speaker adaptation] for [HMM-based TTS] and hierarchical architectures for discriminative [MLSP]. \n",
      " Work on [cross-lingual speaker adaptation] for [HMM-based TTS] has only just started to scratch the surface and is apparent that the rise of statistical parametric [TTS] will likely lead to many more novel challenges in [MLSP] for [TTS]. \n",
      " For example, we have already spoken of joint optimization of combined systems for [speech recognition] and [machine translation]. \n",
      " Conceivably, similar principles could be applied to combined [machine translation] and [speech synthesis] to produce more intelligible translated output. \n",
      " The adaptive [HMM-based framework] also poses an attractive solution for research in polyglot synthesis, without the need for developing [extensive data] resources for [multilingual speakers]. \n",
      " Addressing the tasks of cross [- corpus] normalization and [cross-language contextual modelling] will likely be challenges to overcome if we are to be successful in this. \n",
      " In the domain of [multilingual ASR], methods of [cross-language knowledge transfer] still have considerable potential. \n",
      " With increasing use of lightly supervised techniques and [data mining], there is also increasing need to be able to effectively bootstrap models from [other languages]. \n",
      " Unfortunately, models trained using discriminative criteria are particularly susceptible to transcription errors, possibly making them unsuitable for application in [acoustic model] bootstrapping. \n",
      " By combining hierarchical approaches with discriminative techniques, we may obtain an effective technique for [acoustic model] bootstrapping. \n",
      " Furthermore, in the context of [MLPbased features], there is also need to investigate extensively the use of [other language-independent representation] of [phonetic] information, such as [articulatory features], and modelling of subword unit representations such as [graphemes], especially Roman alphabets which is shared across many [different languages]. \n",
