      " Abstract \n",
      " We present a multispeaker, [multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis model] based on [Tacotron] that is able to produce [high quality speech] in [multiple languages]. \n",
      " Moreover, the model is able to transfer voices across languages, e.g. synthesize fluent Spanish [speech] using an [English speaker]âs voice, without training on any bilingual or parallel examples. \n",
      " Such transfer works across distantly related languages, e.g. English and Mandarin. \n",
      " Critical to achieving this result are : using a [phonemic input representation] to encourage sharing of model capacity across languages, and incorporating an [adversarial loss] term to encourage the model to disentangle its representation of [speaker identity] (which is perfectly correlated with language in the [training data]) from the [speech content]. \n",
      " Further scaling up the model by training on [multiple speakers] of each language, and incorporating an autoencoding input to help stabilize attention during training, results in a model which can be used to consistently synthesize [intelligible speech] for [training speakers] in all languages seen during training, and in native or foreign accents. \n",
      " Index Terms : [speech synthesis], [end-to-end], [adversarial loss] \n",
      "\n",
      " Introduction \n",
      " Recent [end-to-end neural TTS models] have been extended to enable control of [speaker identity] as well as [unlabelled speech attributes], e.g. [prosody], by conditioning synthesis on latent representations in addition to text. \n",
      " Extending such models to support multiple, [unrelated languages] is nontrivial when using [language-dependent input representations] or model components, especially when the amount of training data [per] language is imbalanced. \n",
      " For example, there is no overlap in the text representation between languages like Mandarin and English. Furthermore, recordings from [bilingual speakers] are expensive to collect. It is therefore most common for each speaker in the training set to speak only one language, so [speaker identity] is perfectly correlated with language. \n",
      " This makes it difficult to transfer voices across [different languages], a [desirable feature] when the number of available [training voices] for a [particular language] is small. \n",
      " Moreover, for languages with borrowed or shared words, such as proper nouns in Spanish (ES) and English (EN), pronunciations of the same text might be different. \n",
      " This adds more ambiguity when a naively trained model sometimes generates [accented speech] for a [particular speaker]. \n",
      " Zen et al. proposed a speaker and [language factorization] for [HMM-based parametric TTS system], aiming to transfer a voice from one language to others. \n",
      " proposed a multilingual parametric [neural TTS system], which used a unified [input representation] and shared parameters across languages, however the   voices used for each language were disjoint. \n",
      " described a similar bilingual Chinese and English [neural TTS system] trained on [speech] from a [bilingual speaker], allowing it to [synthesize speech] in both languages using the [same voice]. \n",
      " studied learning pronunciation from a [bilingual TTS model]. \n",
      " Most recently, presented a [multilingual neural TTS model] which supports voice cloning across English, Spanish, and German. \n",
      "\n",
      "                                         \n",
      " Figure : Overview of the components of the proposed model. \n",
      " Dashed lines denote sampling via reparameterization   during training. \n",
      " The prior mean is always use during inference. \n",
      "                                   \n",
      " It used [language-specific text] and [speaker encoders], and incorporated a secondary fine-tuning step to optimize a [speaker identity]-preserving loss, ensuring that the model could output a [consistent voice] regardless of language. \n",
      " We also note that the sound quality is not on par with recent [neural TTS systems], potentially because of its use of the [WORLD vocoder] for [waveform synthesis]. \n",
      " Our work is most similar to, which describes a [multilingual TTS model] based on [Tacotron 2] which uses a Unicode encoding â [byte] â [input representation] to train a model on one speaker of each of English, Spanish, and Mandarin. \n",
      " In this paper, we evaluate different [input representations], scale up the number of [training speakers] for each language, and extend the model to support [cross-lingual voice cloning]. \n",
      " The model is trained in a single stage, with no [language-specific components], and obtains naturalness on par with baseline monolingual models. \n",
      " Our contributions include : \n",
      " Evaluating the effect of using different text [input representations] in a [multilingual TTS model]. \n",
      " Introducing a [per]-input [token speaker-adversarial loss] to enable [cross-lingual voice transfer] when only one [training speaker] is available for each language. \n",
      " Incorporating an [explicit language embedding] to the input, which enables moderate control of [speech accent], independent of [speaker identity], when the [training data] contains [multiple speakers per] language. \n",
      " We evaluate the contribution of each component, and demonstrate the proposed modelâs ability to disentangle speakers from languages and consistently synthesize [high quality speech] for all speakers, despite the perfect correlation to the [original language] in the [training data]. \n",
      "                                         \n",
      " Model Structure \n",
      " We base our [multilingual TTS model] on [Tacotron 2], which uses an [attention-based sequence-to-sequence model] to generate a sequence of log-[mel spectrogram] frames based on an input text sequence. \n",
      " The architecture is illustrated in Figure. \n",
      " It augments the base [Tacotron 2 model] with [additional speaker] and, optionally, [language embedding] inputs (bottom right), an adversarially-trained [speaker classifier] (top right), and a [variational autoencoder]-style [residual encoder] (top left) which conditions the [decoder] on a latent embedding computed from the [target spectrogram] during training (top left). \n",
      " Finally, similar to [Tacotron 2], we separately train a [WaveRNN neural vocoder]. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Input representations] \n",
      " [End-to-end TTS models] have typically used character or [phoneme]   [input representations], or hybrids between them. \n",
      " Recently, proposed using inputs derived from the UTF-8 [byte encoding] in [multilingual settings]. \n",
      " We evaluate the effects of using these representations for [multilingual TTS]. \n",
      "\n",
      " Characters / [Graphemes] \n",
      " Embeddings corresponding to each character or [grapheme] are the default inputs for [end-to-end TTS models], requiring the model to implicitly learn how to pronounce input words (i.e. [grapheme-to-phoneme conversion]) as part of the synthesis task. \n",
      " Extending a [grapheme-based input vocabulary] to a [multilingual setting] is straightforward, by simply concatenating \n",
      " [grapheme sets] in the [training corpus] for each language. \n",
      " This can grow quickly for languages with large alphabets, e.g. our Mandarin vocabulary contains over 4.5k tokens. \n",
      " We simply concatenate all [graphemes] appearing in the [training corpus], leading to a total of 4,619 tokens. \n",
      " Equivalent [graphemes] are shared across languages. \n",
      " During inference all previously unseen characters are mapped to a special out-of-vocabulary (OOV) symbol. \n",
      "\n",
      " UTF-8 Encoded [Bytes] \n",
      " Following   we experiment with an [input representation] based on the UTF-8 text encoding, which uses 256 possible values as each input token where the mapping from [graphemes] to bytes is [language-dependent]. \n",
      " For languages with single-[byte] characters (e.g., English), this representation is equivalent to the [grapheme representation]. \n",
      " However, for languages with multi-[byte] characters (such as Mandarin) the [TTS model] must learn to attend to a consistent [sequence of bytes] to correctly generate the corresponding [speech]. \n",
      " On the other hand, using a UTF-8 [byte representation] may promote sharing of representations between languages due to the smaller number of input tokens. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Phonemes] \n",
      " Using [phoneme inputs] simplifies the [TTS task], as the model no longer needs to learn complicated pronunciation rules for languages such as English. \n",
      " Similar to our [grapheme-based model], equivalent [phonemes] are shared across languages. We concatenate all possible [phoneme symbols], for a total of 88 tokens. \n",
      " To support Mandarin, we include tone information by learning [phoneme-independent embeddings] for each of the 4 possible tones, and broadcast each tone embedding to all [phoneme embeddings] inside the corresponding syllable. \n",
      " For English and Spanish, tone embeddings are replaced by stress embeddings which include primary and secondary stresses. A special symbol is used when there is no tone or stress. \n",
      "\n",
      " [Residual encoder] \n",
      " Following, we augment the [TTS model] by incorporating a [variational autoencoder]-like [residual encoder] which encodes the latent factors in the [training audio], e.g. [prosody] or background noise, which is not well-explained by the conditioning inputs : the text representation, speaker, and [language embeddings]. \n",
      " We follow the structure from, except we use a standard single [Gaussian prior distribution] and reduce the latent dimension to 16. \n",
      " In our experiments, we observe that feeding in the prior mean (all zeros) during inference, significantly improves stability of [cross-lingual speaker transfer] and leads to improved naturalness as shown by [MOS evaluations] in Section. \n",
      "\n",
      " Adversarial training \n",
      " One of the challenges for [multilingual TTS] is [data sparsity], where some languages may only have [training data] for a [few speakers]. \n",
      " In the extreme case where there is only one speaker [per] language in the [training data], the [speaker identity] is essentially the same as the language i d. \n",
      " To encourage the model to learn disentangled representations of the text and [speaker identity], we proactively discourage the text encoding ts from also capturing [speaker information]. \n",
      " We employ domain adversarial training to encourage ti to encode text in a speaker-independent manner by introducing a [speaker classifier] based on the text encoding and a [gradient reversal layer]. \n",
      " Note that the [speaker classifier] is optimized with a different objective than the rest of the model : Lspeaker (Ïs ; ti) = N \n",
      " Ã log p(si | ti), where si is the [speaker label] i and Ïs are the parameters for [speaker classifier]. \n",
      " To train the full model, we insert a [gradient reversal layer]   prior to this [speaker classifier], which scales the gradient by âÎ». \n",
      " Following, we also explore inserting another adversarial layer on top of the [variational autoencoder] to encourage it to learn speaker-independent representations. \n",
      " However, we found that this layer has no effect after decreasing the latent space dimension. \n",
      "                  \n",
      " We impose this [adversarial loss] separately on each element of the encoded text sequence, in order to encourage the model to learn a speaker and [language-independent text embedding space]. \n",
      " In contrast to, which disentangled [speaker identity] from background noise, some input tokens are highly [language-dependent] which can lead to unstable adversarial classifier gradients. \n",
      " We address this by clipping gradients computed at the [reversal layer] to limit the impact of such outliers. \n",
      "\n",
      " Experiments \n",
      " We train models using a [proprietary dataset] composed of [high quality speech] in three languages : 385 hours of English (EN) from 84 [professional voice] actors with accents from the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and Singapore ;   97 hours of Spanish (ES) from 3 [female speakers] include Castilian and US Spanish ; 68 hours of Mandarin (CN) from 5 speakers. \n",

      " Model and training setup \n",
      " The [synthesizer network] uses the [Tacotron 2 architecture], with additional inputs consisting of learned speaker (64-dim) and [language embeddings] (3-dim), concatenated and passed to the [decoder] at each step. \n",
      " The generated [speech] is represented as a sequence of 128-dim log-[mel spectrogram] frames, computed from 50ms windows shifted by 12.5ms. \n",
      " The [variational residual encoder architecture] closely follows the attribute [encoder] in. \n",
      " It maps a variable length [mel spectrogram] to two [vectors] parameterizing the mean and log variance of the [Gaussian posterior]. \n",

      " Based on these results, we only use [phoneme inputs] in the following experiments since this guarantees that pronunciations are correct and results in more [fluent speech]. \n",
      " Table evaluates voice cloning performance of the full [multilingual model] (84EN 3ES 5CN), which is trained on the [full dataset] with increased [speaker coverage], and uses the speaker-[adversarial loss] and speaker / [language embeddings]. \n",
      " Incorporating the [adversarial loss] forces the text representation to be [less language-specific], instead relying on the [language embedding] to capture [language-dependent information]. \n",
      " Across all [language pairs], the model [synthesizes speech] in all voices with naturalness [MOS] above 3.85, demonstrating that increasing [training speaker] diversity improves generalization. \n",
      " In most cases synthesizing EN and ES [speech] (except EN-to-ES) approaches the ground truth scores. In contrast, naturalness of CN [speech] is consistently lower than the ground truth. \n",
      "\n",
      " The high naturalness and similarity [MOS scores] in the top row of Table indicate that the model is able to successfully transfer the EN voice to both ES and CN almost without accent.             \n",
      " When consistently conditioning on the [EN language embedding] regardless of the [target language] (second row), the model produces more English accented ES and CN [speech], which leads to lower naturalness but higher similarity [MOS scores]. \n",
      " Also see Figure and the demo for accent transfer [audio] examples.                                                                                            \n",
      " We see that cloning the [CN voice] to [other languages] (bottom row) has the lowest similarity [MOS], although the scores are still much higher than different-[speaker similarity MOS] in the off-diagonals of Table indicating that there is some degree of transfer. \n",
      " This is a consequence of the [low speaker] coverage of CN compared to EN in the [training data], as well as the large distance between CN and [other languages].                                                                        \n",
      " Finally, Table demonstrates the importance of training using a [variational residual encoder] to stabilize the model output. \n",
      " Naturalness [MOS] decreases by 0.4 points for EN-to-CN cloning without the [residual encoder] (bottom row). \n",
      " In informal comparisons of the outputs of the two models we find that the model without the [residual encoder] tends to skip rare words or inserts unnatural pauses in the output [speech]. \n",
      " This indicates the VAE prior learns a mode which helps stabilize attention. \n",
      "\n",
      " Conclusions \n",
      " We describe extensions to the [Tacotron 2 neural TTS model] which allow training of a [multilingual model] trained only on [monolingual speakers], which is able to synthesize [high quality speech] in three languages, and transfer [training voices] across languages. \n",
      " Furthermore, the model learns to speak [foreign languages] with moderate control of accent, and, as demonstrated on the companion webpage, has rudimentary support for code switching. \n",
      " In future work we plan to investigate methods for scaling up to leverage large amounts of low quality [training data], and support many [more speakers] and languages. \n",
