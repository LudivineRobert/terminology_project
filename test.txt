TUNDRA: A Multilingual Corpus of Found Data for TTS Research Created with Light Supervision

Abstract        
Simple4All Tundra (version 1.0) is the first release of a standardised multilingual corpus designed for text-to-speech research with imperfect or found data.
The corpus consists of approximately 60 hours of speech data from audiobooks in 14 languages, as well as utterance-level alignments obtained with a lightly-supervised process.
Future versions of the corpus will include finer-grained alignment and prosodic annotation, all of which will be made freely available.
This paper gives a general outline of the data collected so far, as well as a detailed description of how this has been done, emphasizing the minimal language-specific knowledge and manual intervention used to compile the corpus.
To demonstrate its potential use, text-to-speech systems have been built for all languages using unsupervised or lightly supervised methods, also briefly presented in the paper.
