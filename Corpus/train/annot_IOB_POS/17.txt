 ABSTRACT PROPN (O) 

 This DET (O) paper NOUN (O) presents VERB (O) a NOUN (O) framework NOUN (O) for ADP (O) building NOUN (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) text NOUN - to ADP - speech NOUN (I) systems NOUN (I)] . 
It PRON (O) addresses VERB (O) the DET (O) issue NOUN (O) at ADP (O) three NUM (O) levels NOUN . (O) 
First ADV (O) it PRON (O) discusses VERB (O) the DET (O) necessary ADJ (O) steps NOUN (O) required VERB (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voice NOUN (I)] from ADP (O) scratch NOUN (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) new ADJ (O) language NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) second NOUN (O) concerns NOUN (O) the DET (O) building NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [new PROPN (B) voice NOUN (I)] without ADP (O) recording NOUN (O) any DET (O) new ADJ (O) [acoustic ADJ (B) data NOUN (I)] , and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) restrictions NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) imposes VERB . (O) 
The DET (O) third NOUN (O) more ADJ (O) speculative ADJ (O) part NOUN (O) discusses VERB (O) the DET (O) steps VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) would VERB (O) be AUX (O) necessary ADJ (O) to ADP (O) allow VERB (O) high ADJ (O) quality NOUN (O) synthesis NOUN (O) of ADP (O) new ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) by ADP (O) recording NOUN (O) only ADV (O) minimal ADJ (O) amounts VERB (O) in ADP (O) that SCONJ (O) language NOUN . (O) 

 BACKGROUND PROPN (O) 

 The DET (O) construction NOUN (O) of ADP (O) high ADJ (O) quality NOUN (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) still ADV (O) very ADV (O) hard ADV . (O) 
However ADV , (O) with ADP (O) better ADJ (O) tools NOUN , (O) the DET (O) advancement NOUN (O) of ADP (O) faster ADV (O) computers NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) more ADJ (O) disk NOUN , (O) the DET (O) job NOUN (O) of ADP (O) building NOUN (O) new ADJ (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] now ADV (O) requires VERB (O) substantially ADV (O) less ADJ (O) resources NOUN (O) both DET (O) in ADP (O) expertise NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) computation NOUN . (O) 
But CCONJ (O) at ADP (O) the DET (O) same ADJ (O) time NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) tools NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) techniques NOUN (O) made VERB (O) it PRON (O) easier ADJ (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) concatenative ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B) synthesizers NOUN (I)] , the DET (O) expectation NOUN (O) for ADP (O) higher ADJ (O) [quality NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] has AUX (O) also ADV (O) increased VERB . (O) 
The DET (O) FestVox NOUN (O) system NOUN (O) provides VERB (O) tools NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) documentation NOUN (O) for ADP (O) [building NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] in ADP (O) new ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) for ADP (O) the DET (O) University PROPN (O) of ADP (O) Edinburgh PROPN ’s PART (O) Festival PROPN (O) [Speech NOUN (B) Synthesis PROPN (I) System NOUN (I)] . 
The DET (O) project NOUN (O) was AUX (O) designed VERB (O) to ADP (O) specifically ADV (O) address NOUN (O) the DET (O) issues NOUN (O) of ADP (O) building NOUN (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] for ADP (O) minority NOUN (O) languages NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) well INTJ (O) as SCONJ (O) major NOUN (O) ones NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) work NOUN (O) of ADP (O) documenting NOUN (O) the DET (O) process NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [building NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] in ADP (O) new ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) rose VERB (O) out NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) number NOUN (O) of ADP (O) student NOUN (O) projects NOUN (O) carried VERB (O) out NOUN (O) at ADP (O) Edinburgh PROPN (O) University PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) elsewhere ADV (O) including VERB (O) the DET (O) German PROPN (O) [diphone NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] created VERB (O) at ADP (O) a NOUN (O) summer NOUN (O) workshop NOUN (O) at ADP (O) OGI PROPN , (O) in ADP (O) 1998 NUM . (O) 
Although SCONJ (O) the DET (O) initial NOUN (O) tools NOUN (O) emphasized VERB (O) [diphone NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] , the DET (O) tools NOUN (O) have AUX (O) matured ADJ (O) to ADP (O) support NOUN (O) generalized VERB (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) voices NOUN (I)] too ADV . (O) 
The DET (O) projects NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) have AUX (O) used VERB (O) these DET (O) tools NOUN (O) have AUX (O) varied ADJ (O) drastically ADV (O) in ADP (O) size NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) effort NOUN (O) involving VERB (O) large ADJ (O) commercial NOUN (O) entities NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) well INTJ (O) as SCONJ (O) individual NOUN (O) students NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) voices NOUN (O) built VERB (O) equally ADV (O) varies VERB , (O) and CCONJ (O) many ADJ (O) find VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) usable ADJ (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voice NOUN (I)] in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) new ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) is AUX (O) still ADV (O) a NOUN (O) substantial NOUN (O) task NOUN (O) even ADV (O) if SCONJ (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) easier ADJ (O) than SCONJ (O) it PRON (O) was AUX . (O) 
We PRON (O) are AUX (O) aware ADJ (O) of ADP (O) at ADP (O) least ADJ (O) 40 NUM (O) different ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) this DET (O) work NOUN (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) used VERB (O) for ADP (O) including VERB , (O) major ADJ (O) European PROPN (O) languages NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) English PROPN . , (O) German ADJ , (O) French PROPN , (O) Italian PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) Spanish PROPN , (O) European PROPN (O) minority NOUN (O) languages NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) Scots NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) Irish PROPN (O) Gaelic PROPN , (O) Basque PROPN , (O) etc X . , (O) Asian PROPN (O) languages NOUN (O) including VERB (O) Chinese PROPN , (O) Thai PROPN , (O) Korean PROPN , (O) Japanese PROPN , (O) many ADJ (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) Indian PROPN (O) sub ADJ - continent ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) well INTJ (O) as SCONJ (O) Nepali PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) Pashtu PROPN , (O) and CCONJ (O) other ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) from ADP (O) different ADJ (O) linguistic ADJ (O) groups NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) Arabic PROPN , (O) Turkish ADJ , (O) Finnish PROPN , (O) Maori NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) even ADV (O) Klingon PROPN .

It PRON (O) seems VERB (O) building NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) [new PROPN (B) voice NOUN (I)] in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) new ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) is AUX (O) understood VERB (O) well INTJ (O) enough ADJ (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) set NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) student NOUN (O) project NOUN . (O) 

 BUILDING PROPN (O) A NOUN (O) VOICE PROPN (O) 

 To PART (O) build NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) voice NOUN (O) one NUM (O) must VERB (O) address NOUN (O) the DET (O) following VERB (O) issues NOUN (O) : 

 Define NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) [phoneme NOUN (B) set NOUN (I)] 
Create VERB (O) a NOUN (O) [lexicon PROPN (B)] and/or CCONJ (O) letter NOUN (O) to ADP (O) sounds VERB (O) rules VERB (O) 
Provide PROPN (O) text NOUN (O) analysis NOUN (O) 
Build PROPN (O) prosodic PROPN (O) models NOUN (O) 
Build PROPN (O) a NOUN (O) [waveform PROPN (B) synthesizer NOUN (I)] 

 All DET (O) of ADP (O) these DET (O) basic ADJ (O) processes VERB (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) fairly ADV (O) mechanistic ADJ . (O) 
Although SCONJ (O) adequate ADJ (O) solutions NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) found VERB (O) for ADP (O) most ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) very ADV (O) hard ADJ (O) in ADP (O) general NOUN (O) to ADP (O) find VERB (O) excellent ADJ (O) solutions NOUN . (O) 
Many ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) have AUX (O) had AUX (O) significant ADJ (O) [phonological NOUN (B) study NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) [phoneme NOUN (B) set NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) well INTJ (O) defined VERB . (O) 
However ADV , (O) in ADP (O) practice NOUN (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) typical ADJ (O) to ADP (O) find VERB (O) a NOUN (O) number NOUN (O) of ADP (O) different ADJ (O) [phoneme NOUN (B) sets VERB (I)] defined VERB (O) with ADP (O) some DET (O) ambiguity NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) even ADV (O) within ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [phoneme NOUN (B) set NOUN (I)] there PRON (O) may VERB (O) be AUX (O) different ADJ (O) choices NOUN (O) in ADP (O) particular ADJ (O) uses VERB . (O) 
For ADP (O) example NOUN , (O) even ADV (O) in ADP (O) US PROPN (O) English PROPN (O) there PRON (O) are AUX (O) choices NOUN , (O) should VERB (O) /dx/ NOUN (O) (a DET (O) tap NOUN) (O) be AUX (O) [phonetic NOUN (B)] ? Or CCONJ , (O) should VERB (O) /axr/ PUNCT (O) be AUX (O) distinct ADJ (O) from ADP (O) unstressed ADJ (O) /er/ PROPN (O) ? A NOUN (O) first ADJ (O) approximation NOUN (O) is AUX (O) usually ADV (O) relatively ADV (O) easy ADJ , (O) but CCONJ (O) there PRON (O) are AUX (O) always ADV (O) harder ADJ (O) questions NOUN (O) about ADP (O) the DET (O) best ADJ (O) set VERB , (O) eventually ADV (O) we PRON (O) would VERB (O) like INTJ (O) some DET (O) acoustically ADV (O) derived VERB (O) method NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) is AUX (O) correlated VERB (O) with ADP (O) the DET (O) particular ADJ (O) idiolect NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) speaker NOUN (O) being NOUN (O) modeled VERB . (O) 
[Lexicon PROPN (B)] construction NOUN (O) is AUX (O) hard ADV , (O) and CCONJ (O) as SCONJ (O) consistency NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) entries NOUN (O) is AUX (O) very ADV (O) important ADJ (O) we PRON (O) have AUX (O) provided VERB (O) techniques NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) aid NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) construction NOUN (O) of ADP (O) new ADJ (O) [lexicons NOUN (B)] . 
For ADP (O) some DET (O) languages NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) hand NOUN (O) written VERB (O) set NOUN (O) of ADP (O) letter NOUN (O) to ADP (O) sound NOUN (O) rules VERB (O) is AUX (O) possible ADJ (O) especially ADV (O) where ADV (O) the DET (O) relationship NOUN (O) between ADP (O) orthography PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) [phonetics NOUN (B)] is AUX (O) close ADV . (O) 
We PRON (O) also ADV (O) provide VERB (O) automatic PROPN (O) learning NOUN (O) techniques NOUN (O) for ADP (O) building NOUN (O) letter NOUN (O) to ADP (O) sound NOUN (O) rules VERB (O) from ADP (O) existing VERB (O) words NOUN (O) with ADP (O) pronunciations NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) relative NOUN (O) success NOUN (O) of ADP (O) these DET (O) methods NOUN (O) are AUX (O) both DET (O) a NOUN (O) measure NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) consistency NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [lexicons NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) relative NOUN (O) difficulty NOUN (O) of ADP (O) pronunciation NOUN (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) language NOUN . (O) 
A NOUN (O) more ADJ (O) general NOUN (O) technique NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) may VERB (O) be AUX (O) adequate ADJ (O) when ADV (O) no DET (O) [lexicon PROPN (B)] is AUX (O) available ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) orthography NOUN (O) is AUX (O) believed VERB (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) close NOUN (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) [phonology NOUN (B)] is AUX (O) to ADP (O) use NOUN (O) the DET (O) letters NOUN (O) directly ADV (O) as SCONJ (O) [phonemes NOUN (B)] . 
showed VERB (O) how ADV (O) a NOUN (O) [letter NOUN - based VERB (B) phoneme NOUN (I) set VERB (I)] worked VERB (O) adequately ADV (O) for ADP (O) Spanish PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) could VERB (O) even ADV (O) capture NOUN (O) dialectal ADJ (O) variation NOUN (O) in ADP (O) Castillian PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) Colombian PROPN (O) Spanish PROPN , (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) letter NOUN (O) “ PUNCT (O) c NOUN (O) ” PUNCT (O) as SCONJ (O) /th/ PUNCT (O) or CCONJ (O) /s/. PUNCT (O) 
Even ADV (O) for ADP (O) English PROPN (O) this DET (O) technique NOUN (O) works VERB (O) to ADP (O) some DET (O) degree NOUN . (O) 
For ADP (O) some DET (O) languages NOUN , (O) we PRON (O) believe VERB (O) a NOUN (O) workable ADJ (O) [letter NOUN - based VERB (B) phone NOUN (I) set VERB (I)] may VERB (O) be AUX (O) successful ADJ . (O) 
However ADV (O) in ADP (O) our DET (O) experience NOUN (O) with ADP (O) building NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) Pashtu PROPN (O) synthesizer PROPN , (O) where ADV (O) no DET (O) standardized ADJ (O) orthography NOUN (O) exists VERB , (O) confusion NOUN (O) between ADP (O) the DET (O) writing NOUN (O) system NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) many ADJ (O) varied ADJ (O) dialects VERB (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) language NOUN (O) lead NOUN (O) to ADP (O) more ADJ (O) problems NOUN (O) than SCONJ (O) the DET (O) orthography NOUN (O) / [phonetic ADJ (B)] relationship NOUN (O) itself PRON . (O) 
[Statistical PROPN (B) data NOUN - driven VERB (I) approaches VERB (I)] to PART (O) prosodic PROPN (O) models NOUN , (O) for ADP (O) phrasing NOUN , (O) intonation NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) duration NOUN , (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) build NOUN (O) fairly ADV (O) easily ADV (O) for ADP (O) at ADP (O) least ADJ (O) “ PUNCT (O) neutral ADJ (O) ” PUNCT (O) sentences NOUN . (O) 
Within PROPN (O) a NOUN (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) framework NOUN (I)] it PRON (O) is AUX (O) common ADJ (O) not PART (O) to ADP (O) explicitly ADV (O) model NOUN (O) [prosody NOUN (B)] but CCONJ (O) rely VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) implicit PROPN (O) modeling NOUN (O) provided VERB (O) by ADP (O) the DET (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) process NOUN (I)] . 

 [UNIT NOUN (B) SELECTION PROPN (I) SYNTHESIS PROPN (I)] IN ADP (O) ANY DET (O) LANGUAGE PROPN (O) 

 [Unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] , can VERB (O) offer NOUN (O) high ADJ (O) quality NOUN (O) synthesis NOUN (O) without ADP (O) the DET (O) expert NOUN (O) work NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) would VERB (O) be AUX (O) required VERB (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) formant NOUN (O) synthesizer PROPN . (O) 
Although SCONJ (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] can VERB (O) produce NOUN (O) high ADJ (O) quality NOUN (O) synthesis NOUN , (O) the DET (O) database NOUN (O) must VERB (O) be AUX (O) properly ADV (O) designed VERB (O) to ADP (O) have AUX (O) the DET (O) right ADV (O) coverage NOUN (O) for ADP (O) the DET (O) language NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) domain NOUN (O) so CCONJ (O) that SCONJ (O) the DET (O) quality NOUN (O) is AUX (O) reasonable ADJ . (O) 
discusses NOUN (O) the DET (O) limitations VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) optimizations NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) can VERB (O) help NOUN (O) in ADP (O) achieving VERB (O) high ADJ (O) [quality NOUN (B) databases NOUN (I)] for ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] . 
In ADP (O) our DET (O) present NOUN (O) set NOUN - up ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [reasonable ADJ (B) database NOUN (I)] can VERB (O) be AUX (O) found VERB (O) by ADP (O) first ADJ (O) selecting NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) large ADJ (O) body NOUN (O) of ADP (O) text NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) [target NOUN (B) language NOUN (I)] (millions NOUN (O) of ADP (O) words NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) more ADJ (O) is AUX (O) good ADJ) . (O) 
Then ADV (O) using VERB (O) a NOUN (O) synthesizer NOUN (O) front NOUN (O) end NOUN , (O) that SCONJ (O) can VERB (O) segment NOUN (O) the DET (O) text NOUN (O) into ADP (O) sentences NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) then ADV (O) convert NOUN (O) the DET (O) text NOUN (O) to ADP (O) [phoneme NOUN (B) strings NOUN (I)] . 
We PRON (O) can VERB (O) then ADV (O) select VERB (O) sentences NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) will VERB (O) best ADJ (O) cover NOUN (O) the DET (O) desired VERB (O) [phonetic NOUN (B)] space NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) language NOUN , (O) optimizing NOUN (O) for ADP (O) diphone NOUN (O) / syllable ADJ (O) coverage NOUN (O) depending VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) language NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) object NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) exercise NOUN (O) is AUX (O) to ADP (O) 
find VERB (O) a NOUN (O) relatively ADV (O) small ADJ (O) set NOUN (O) of ADP (O) utterances VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) are AUX (O) both DET (O) natural ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) phonetically ADV (O) balanced VERB . (O) 
We PRON (O) typically ADV (O) put VERB (O) other ADJ (O) restrictions NOUN (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) selection NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) ensure VERB (O) all DET (O) words NOUN (O) are AUX (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) [lexicon PROPN (B)] , and CCONJ (O) limit NOUN (O) sentences NOUN (O) to ADP (O) under ADP (O) 20 NUM (O) words NOUN (O) in ADP (O) length NOUN . (O) 
This DET (O) makes VERB (O) the DET (O) utterances VERB (O) easier ADJ (O) to ADP (O) say VERB , (O) reducing VERB (O) the DET (O) effort NOUN (O) required VERB (O) from ADP (O) the DET (O) [voice NOUN (B) talent NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) minimizing NOUN (O) errors NOUN (O) in ADP (O) their DET (O) performance NOUN . (O) 
Having VERB (O) around ADP (O) 1000 NUM (O) sentences NOUN (O) (perhaps ADV (O) around ADP (O) 40,000 NUM (O) [phonemes NOUN (B)]) seems VERB (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) reasonable ADJ . (O) 
We PRON (O) have AUX (O) also ADV (O) experimented VERB (O) with ADP (O) a NOUN (O) more ADJ (O) elaborate VERB (O) selection NOUN (O) technique NOUN , (O) where ADV (O) we PRON (O) first ADJ (O) model NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) [particular ADJ (B) speaker NOUN (I)] ’s VERB acoustic ADJ (O) variation NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) [select NOUN (B) data NOUN (I)] based VERB (O) on ADP (O) their DET (O) actual ADJ (O) usage NOUN (O) rather ADV (O) than SCONJ (O) just ADV (O) general NOUN (O) [phonemes NOUN (B)] . 
This DET (O) may VERB (O) perform VERB (O) better ADJ (O) but CCONJ (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) more ADJ (O) computationally ADV (O) expensive ADJ , (O) and CCONJ (O) requires VERB (O) an DET (O) existing VERB (O) model NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) speaker NOUN , (O) which DET (O) may VERB (O) not PART (O) be AUX (O) available ADJ (O) when ADV (O) building NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) new ADJ (O) language NOUN . (O) 
We PRON (O) used VERB (O) the DET (O) simpler ADJ (O) technique NOUN (O) in ADP (O) building NOUN (O) the DET (O) CMU PROPN (O) [ARCTIC PROPN (B) voices NOUN (I)] , and CCONJ (O) have AUX (O) successfully ADV (O) used VERB (O) very ADV (O) similar ADJ (O) techniques NOUN (O) for ADP (O) a NOUN (O) wide ADJ (O) range NOUN (O) of ADP (O) languages NOUN (O) including VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) Croatian PROPN , (O) Thai PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) Spanish PROPN . (O) 
Also ADV (O) we PRON (O) note NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) given VERB (O) a NOUN (O) suitably ADV (O) balanced ADJ (O) set NOUN (O) of ADP (O) utterances VERB (O) we PRON (O) can VERB (O) more ADJ (O) accurately ADV (O) automatically ADV (O) label NOUN (O) the DET (O) data NOUN (O) using VERB (O) acoustic ADJ (O) modeling NOUN (O) [HMM PROPN (B) tools NOUN (I)] such ADJ (O) as SCONJ . (O) 
The DET (O) quality NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) ease NOUN (O) with ADP (O) which DET (O) a NOUN (O) synthesizer NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) built VERB (O) is AUX (O) still ADV (O) very ADV (O) dependent ADJ (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [voice NOUN (B) talent NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) recording NOUN (O) set NOUN (O) up ADP . (O) 
Even ADV (O) with ADP (O) [professional ADJ (B) voice NOUN (I)] actors NOUN (O) we PRON (O) have AUX (O) found VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) speakers NOUN (O) who PRON (O) have AUX (O) recorded VERB (O) for ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) synthesizers NOUN (I)] before ADP (O) perform VERB (O) better ADJ . (O) 
Thus ADV (O) there PRON (O) is AUX (O) a NOUN (O) consistency NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) style NOUN (O) of ADP (O) delivery NOUN (O) which DET (O) leads VERB (O) to ADP (O) a NOUN (O) better ADJ (O) synthesizer PROPN . (O) 
Perhaps ADV (O) one NUM (O) should VERB (O) always ADV (O) throw VERB (O) away ADV (O) the DET (O) first ADJ (O) recordings VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) make VERB (O) the DET (O) speaker NOUN (O) do AUX (O) it PRON (O) a NOUN (O) second ADJ (O) time NOUN . (O) 

 EVALUATION PROPN (O) 

 Evaluation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [text NOUN - to ADP - speech NOUN (B)] is AUX (O) very ADV (O) hard ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) the DET (O) ultimate ADJ (O) quality NOUN (O) is AUX (O) based VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) perception NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) listener NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) more ADJ (O) the DET (O) listener NOUN (O) listens VERB (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) voice NOUN (O) the DET (O) more ADJ (O) accustomed PROPN (O) they PRON (O) are AUX (O) to ADP (O) its DET (O) irregularities NOUN . (O) 
This DET (O) is AUX , (O) perhaps ADV , (O) why ADV (O) ones NOUN (O) own ADJ (O) synthesizer NOUN (O) always ADV (O) sounds VERB (O) better ADJ (O) than SCONJ (O) others NOUN . (O)
