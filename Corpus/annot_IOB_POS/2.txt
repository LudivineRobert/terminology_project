 Research PROPN (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] should VERB (O) be AUX (O) of ADP (O) particular ADJ (O) interest NOUN (O) to ADP (O) countries NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) India PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) Switzerland PROPN (O) where ADV (O) there PRON (O) are AUX (O) several ADJ (O) officially ADV (O) recognized VERB (O) languages NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) many ADJ (O) more ADJ (O) additional ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) are AUX (O) commonly ADV (O) spoken VERB . (O) 
 In ADP (O) such ADJ (O) multilingual ADJ (O) environments NOUN , (O) the DET (O) language NOUN (O) barrier NOUN (O) can VERB (O) pose NOUN (O) significant ADJ (O) difficulties NOUN (O) in ADP (O) both DET (O) commerce NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) government NOUN (O) administration NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) technological NOUN (O) advances VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) could VERB (O) help NOUN (O) break NOUN (O) down ADP (O) this DET (O) barrier NOUN (O) would VERB (O) be AUX (O) of ADP (O) great ADJ (O) cultural ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) economic ADJ (O) value NOUN . (O) 
 In ADP (O) this DET (O) paper NOUN , (O) we PRON (O) discuss VERB (O) current ADJ (O) trends NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] and CCONJ (O) how ADV (O) these DET (O) relate VERB (O) to ADP (O) advances VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) general NOUN (O) domain NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) and CCONJ (I) language NOUN (I) technology NOUN (I)] . 
 Examples NOUN (O) of ADP (O) current NOUN (O) advances VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) trends NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) field NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] are AUX (O) provided VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) form NOUN (O) of ADP (O) case NOUN (O) studies NOUN (O) of ADP (O) research NOUN (O) being NOUN (O) conducted VERB (O) at ADP (O) Idiap PROPN (O) Research NOUN (O) Institute PROPN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) framework NOUN (O) of ADP (O) international ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) national ADJ (O) research NOUN (O) programmes NOUN . (O) 
 The DET (O) first ADJ (O) case NOUN (O) study NOUN (O) presents VERB (O) work NOUN (O) in ADP (O) personalized ADJ (O) [speech NOUN - to ADP - speech NOUN (B) translation NOUN (I)] , in ADP (O) which DET (O) we PRON (O) have AUX (O) made VERB (O) significant ADJ (O) advances VERB (O) in ADP (O) developing VERB (O) methods NOUN (O) for ADP (O) [unsupervised ADJ (B) cross ADJ - lingual ADJ (I) adaptation NOUN (I)] of ADP (O) [hidden VERB (B) Markov PROPN (I) model NOUN (I)] (HMM)-based X (O) [speech NOUN (B) synthesis NOUN (I)] . 
 In ADP (O) addition NOUN , (O) this DET (O) work NOUN (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) closely ADV (O) linked VERB (O) with ADP (O) efforts NOUN (O) to ADP (O) develop VERB (O) unified ADJ (O) models NOUN (O) for ADP (O) [automatic PROPN (B) speech NOUN (I) recognition NOUN (I)] ([ASR PROPN (B)]) and CCONJ (O) [text NOUN - to ADP - speech NOUN (B) synthesis NOUN (I)] ([TTS PROPN (B)]) , thus ADV (O) highlighting NOUN (O) the DET (O) potential NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] to PART (O) impact NOUN (O) broader ADJ (O) research NOUN (O) topics NOUN . (O) 
 The DET (O) second NOUN (O) case NOUN (O) study NOUN (O) looks VERB (O) at ADP (O) discriminative NOUN (O) methods NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] and CCONJ (O) how ADV (O) these DET (O) have AUX (O) been AUX (O) applied VERB (O) to ADP (O) problems NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] . 
 This DET (O) includes VERB (O) a NOUN (O) study NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) acoustic ADJ (I) models NOUN (I)] , in ADP (O) particular ADJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) context NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [multilayer NOUN (B) perceptron PROPN (I)] (MLP)-based VERB (O) [discriminative NOUN (B) feature NOUN (I)] extraction NOUN . (O) 
 The DET (O) major NOUN (O) component NOUN (O) of ADP (O) this DET (O) study NOUN (O) is AUX (O) the DET (O) use NOUN (O) of ADP (O) hierarchical PROPN (O) classification NOUN (O) frameworks PROPN (O) that SCONJ (O) have AUX (O) the DET (O) potential NOUN (O) to ADP (O) provide VERB (O) more ADJ (O) robust ADJ (O) performance NOUN (O) while SCONJ (O) simplifying VERB (O) means VERB (O) to ADP (O) perform VERB (O) crosslanguage NOUN (O) knowledge NOUN (O) transfer NOUN . (O) 
 The DET (O) third NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) final ADJ (O) case NOUN (O) study NOUN (O) looks VERB (O) at ADP (O) the DET (O) related ADJ (O) tasks NOUN (O) of ADP (O) language NOUN (O) identification NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) out SCONJ - of ADP - language NOUN (O) detection NOUN (O) using VERB (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] . 
 The DET (O) paper NOUN (O) is AUX (O) organized VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) follows VERB (O) : in ADP (O) section NOUN , (O) we PRON (O) present NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) brief NOUN (O) literature NOUN (O) review NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) speech NOUN (I) processing NOUN (I)] , followed VERB (O) by ADP (O) a NOUN (O) study NOUN (O) of ADP (O) more ADJ (O) recent ADJ (O) trends NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) and CCONJ (I) language NOUN (I) technology NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) how ADV (O) these DET (O) impact NOUN (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] in ADP (O) section NOUN . (O) 
 In ADP (O) sections NOUN , (O) we PRON (O) present NOUN (O) the DET (O) three NUM (O) case NOUN (O) studies NOUN (O) on ADP (O) work NOUN (O) being NOUN (O) conducted VERB (O) at ADP (O) Idiap PROPN (O) on ADP (O) personalized ADJ (O) [speech NOUN - to ADP - speech NOUN (B) translation NOUN (I)] , [discriminative NOUN (B) features VERB (I)] in ADP (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) ASR PROPN (I)] , and CCONJ (O) language NOUN (O) identification NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) out SCONJ - of ADP - language NOUN (O) detection NOUN , (O) respectively ADV . (O) 
 Finally ADV , (O) in ADP (O) section NOUN (O) we PRON (O) provide VERB (O) some DET (O) insights NOUN (O) into ADP (O) future NOUN (O) opportunities NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) challenges VERB (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] . 

[Multilingual ADJ (B) speech NOUN (I) processing NOUN (I)] 

In ADP (O) language NOUN , (O) there PRON (O) are AUX (O) normally ADV (O) two NUM (O) forms NOUN (O) of ADP (O) communication NOUN , (O) namely ADV , (O) spoken VERB (O) form NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) written VERB (O) form NOUN . (O) 
 Depending VERB (O) upon SCONJ (O) the DET (O) granularity NOUN (O) of ADP (O) representation NOUN , (O) both DET (O) these DET (O) forms NOUN (O) can VERB (O) have AUX (O) different ADJ (O) or CCONJ (O) common ADJ (O) representation NOUN (O) in ADP (O) terms NOUN (O) of ADP (O) basic ADJ (O) units NOUN . (O) 
 For ADP (O) instance NOUN , (O) in ADP (O) spoken VERB (O) form NOUN , (O) [phonemes NOUN (B)] / syllables NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) considered VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) the DET (O) basic ADJ (O) unit NOUN . (O) 
 Similarly ADV , (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) case NOUN (O) of ADP (O) (most ADV) (O) written VERB (O) forms NOUN , (O) [graphemes NOUN (B)] / characters NOUN (O) are AUX (O) the DET (O) smallest ADJ (O) basic ADJ (O) units NOUN . (O) 
 However ADV , (O) above ADV (O) the DET (O) smaller ADJ (O) units NOUN , (O) a NOUN (O) word NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) seen VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) common ADJ (O) unit NOUN (O) for ADP (O) both DET (O) spoken VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) written VERB (O) forms NOUN . (O) 
 The DET (O) word NOUN (O) then ADV (O) in ADP (O) turn VERB (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) described VERB (O) in ADP (O) terms NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) smaller ADJ (O) basic ADJ (O) units NOUN (O) corresponding VERB (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) spoken VERB (O) form NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) written VERB (O) form NOUN . (O) 
 For ADP (O) a NOUN (O) given VERB (O) language NOUN , (O) there PRON (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) a NOUN (O) consistent ADJ (O) relationship NOUN (O) between ADP (O) spoken VERB (O) form NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) written VERB (O) form NOUN . (O) 
 However ADV , (O) the DET (O) relationship NOUN (O) may VERB (O) not PART (O) be AUX (O) same ADJ (O) across ADP (O) languages NOUN . (O) 
 Addressing VERB (O) the DET (O) issue NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) common ADJ (O) basic ADJ (O) representation NOUN (O) across ADP (O) languages NOUN (O) is AUX (O) central PROPN (O) to ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] , although SCONJ (O) this DET (O) can VERB (O) raise VERB (O) different ADJ (O) challenges VERB (O) in ADP (O) applications NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] and CCONJ (O) [TTS PROPN (B)] . 
 It PRON (O) is AUX (O) important ADJ (O) to ADP (O) note NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) not PART (O) all DET (O) languages NOUN (O) spoken VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) world NOUN (O) have AUX (O) both DET (O) forms NOUN . (O) 
 There PRON (O) are AUX (O) languages NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) have AUX (O) spoken VERB (O)     form NOUN (O) but CCONJ (O) no DET (O) written VERB (O) form NOUN . (O) 
 It PRON (O) should VERB (O) be AUX (O) noted VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) in ADP (O) case NOUN (O) of ADP (O) some DET (O) languages NOUN , (O) the DET (O) written VERB (O) form NOUN (O) of ADP (O) word NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) character NOUN (O) representation NOUN (O) may VERB (O) be AUX (O)     considered VERB (O) same ADJ (O) ; e.g. ADV (O) Mandarin PROPN (O) language NOUN . (O) 
 Most ADJ (O) commonly ADV , (O) the DET (O) idea NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) unified ADJ (O) [phonetic NOUN (B) lexicon PROPN (I)] is AUX (O) often ADV (O) used VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) the DET (O) binding VERB (O) element NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B) systems NOUN (I)] . 
 Such ADJ (O) a NOUN (O) [lexicon PROPN (B)] is AUX (O) available ADJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) International PROPN (O) [Phonetic PROPN (B)] Association PROPN (O) [(IPA PROPN) (B) system NOUN (I)] . 
 Most ADJ (O) [phonetic NOUN (B) lexicons NOUN (I)] are AUX (O) in ADP (O) practice NOUN (O) just ADV (O) alternative NOUN (O) parameterizations NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [IPA PROPN (B) symbols NOUN (I)] . 
 Some DET (O) [IPA PROPN (B) symbols NOUN (I)] are AUX (O) difficult ADJ (O) to ADP (O) represent VERB (O) in ADP (O) computers NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) are AUX (O) catered VERB (O) to ADP (O) by ADP (O) using VERB (O) the DET (O) SAMPA3 PUNCT (O) and CCONJ (O) SAMPROSA4 X (O) systems NOUN . (O) 
 Although SCONJ (O) [SAMPA NOUN (B)] was AUX (O) originally ADV (O) designed VERB (O) for ADP (O) just ADV (O) European PROPN (O) languages NOUN , (O) it PRON (O) has AUX (O) occasionally ADV (O) been AUX (O) extended ADJ (O) to ADP (O) others NOUN (O) (e.g. ADV , (O) Chinese PROPN) . (O) 
 The DET (O) worldbet NOUN (O) system NOUN (O) described VERB (O) in ADP (O) is AUX (O) more ADJ (O) thorough ADJ . (O) 
 There PRON (O) is AUX (O) a NOUN (O) one NUM - to ADP - one NUM (O) mapping NOUN (O) between ADP , (O) say VERB , (O) ARPABET5 NOUN (O) symbols NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) [IPA PROPN (B) symbols NOUN (I)] ; notation NOUN (O) aside ADV , (O) the DET (O) former ADJ (O) is AUX (O) just ADV (O) a NOUN (O) subset NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) latter ADJ . (O) 
 A PROPN (O) drawback NOUN (O) of ADP (O) such ADJ (O) a NOUN (O) common ADJ (O) representation NOUN (O) is AUX (O) that SCONJ (O) it PRON (O) can VERB (O) preclude NOUN (O) the DET (O) possibility NOUN (O) of ADP (O) tuning NOUN (O) aspects NOUN (O) of ADP (O) systems NOUN (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) particular ADJ (O) language NOUN . (O) 
 For ADP (O) instance NOUN , (O) the DET (O) C NOUN (O) – PUNCT (O) V NOUN (O) syllable NOUN (O) structure NOUN (O) of ADP (O) Japanese PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) tonal NOUN (O) nature NOUN (O) of ADP (O) Chinese PROPN (O) would VERB (O) normally ADV (O) be AUX (O) hardwired VERB (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) monolingual NOUN (O) system NOUN , (O) but CCONJ (O) this DET (O) may VERB (O) not PART (O) be AUX (O) feasible ADJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) multilingual ADJ (O) case NOUN . (O) 
 In ADP (O) the DET (O) remainder NOUN (O) of ADP (O) this DET (O) section NOUN , (O) we PRON (O) give VERB (O) a NOUN (O) brief NOUN (O) survey NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] in ADP (O) the DET (O) context NOUN (O) of ADP (O) specific ADJ (O) applications NOUN , (O) concentrating VERB (O) on ADP (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] and CCONJ (O) [TTS PROPN (B)] .

 In ADP (O) building NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) systems NOUN (I)] , a DET (O) major ADJ (O) issue NOUN (O) is AUX (O) the DET (O) availability NOUN (O) of ADP (O) resources NOUN . (O)

 An PROPN (O) early ADV (O) example NOUN (O) is AUX (O) the DET (O) OGI PROPN (O) multi ADJ - language ADJ (O) telephone NOUN (O) [speech NOUN (B) corpus NOUN (I)] .

 Specifically ADV , (O) how ADV (O) [data NOUN (B) resources NOUN (I)] for ADP (O) a NOUN (O) given VERB (O) language(s PROPN) (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) used VERB (O) to ADP (O) improve VERB (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] in ADP (O) another DET (O) language NOUN , (O) in ADP (O) particular ADJ (O) when ADV (O) resources VERB (O) for ADP (O) that SCONJ (O) language NOUN (O) are AUX (O) lacking NOUN .

 Much ADJ (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) work NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [cross ADJ - language ADJ (B) transfer NOUN (I)] has AUX (O) built VERB (O) upon SCONJ (O) progress NOUN (O) already ADV (O) made VERB (O) in ADP (O) multilingual ADJ (O) modelling NOUN . (O) 
 A NOUN (O) trivial ADJ (O) approach NOUN (O) to ADP (O) building NOUN (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) models NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) to ADP (O) construct VERB (O) separate ADJ (O) acoustic ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) language NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) for ADP (O) each DET (O) desired VERB (O) language NOUN , (O) i.e. X , (O) a NOUN (O) monolingual NOUN (O) system NOUN (O) for ADP (O) each DET (O) language NOUN .

 During ADP (O) recognition NOUN , (O) multiple NOUN (O) [decoders NOUN (B)] corresponding VERB (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) different ADJ (O) monolingual NOUN (O) systems NOUN (O) are AUX (O) run NOUN (O) in ADP (O) parallel NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) recognizer PROPN (O) output NOUN (O) yielding VERB (O) the DET (O) [maximum NOUN (B) likelihood NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) selected VERB .

 As SCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) by ADP - product NOUN , (O) the DET (O) identity NOUN (O) of ADP (O) language NOUN (O) is AUX (O) also ADV (O) inferred VERB . (O) 
 Such ADJ (O) an DET (O) approach NOUN (O) is AUX (O) simple ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) feasible ADJ . (O) 
 However ADV , (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) light NOUN (O) of ADP (O) practical ADJ (O) issues NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) portability NOUN (O) to ADP (O) new ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) (especially ADV (O) with ADP (O) fewer ADJ (O) resources NOUN) , (O) system NOUN (O) memory NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) computational ADJ (O) requirements NOUN , (O) it PRON (O) may VERB (O) not PART (O) be AUX (O) the DET (O) best ADJ (O) approach NOUN .

 Given VERB (O) this DET , (O) there PRON (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) considerable ADJ (O) effort NOUN (O) devoted ADJ (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) [acoustic ADJ (B) models NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) language NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) are AUX (O) shared VERB (O) across ADP (O) languages NOUN .

 Along ADP (O) the DET (O) direction NOUN (O) of ADP (O) multilingual ADJ (O) acoustic ADJ (O) modelling NOUN , (O) the DET (O) emphasis NOUN (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) towards ADP (O) finding NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) common ADJ (O) sound NOUN (O) unit NOUN (O) representation NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) is AUX (O) shared VERB (O) across ADP (O) languages NOUN . (O) 
 In ADP (O) the DET (O) literature NOUN , (O) a NOUN (O) popular ADJ (O) approach NOUN (O) towards ADP (O) this DET (O) is AUX (O) the DET (O) creation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) ‘ PUNCT (O) universal ADJ (O) / global ADJ ’ PUNCT (O) [phone NOUN (B) set NOUN (I)] by ADP (O) first ADJ (O) pooling VERB (O) the DET (O) [phone NOUN (B) sets NOUN (I)] of ADP (O) different ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) together ADV (O) and CCONJ (O) then ADV (O) merging NOUN (O) them PRON (O) (i NOUN) (O) based VERB (O) on ADP (O) heuristics NOUN (O) / knowledge NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) [IPA PROPN - based VERB (B)] (Köhler NOUN (O) 1996 NUM) (O) or CCONJ (O) [SAMPA NOUN - based VERB (B)] (Ackermann PROPN (O) et NOUN (O) al PROPN (O) 1996 NUM) , (O) [articulatory ADJ (B) features VERB (I)] , (ii PROPN) (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) data NOUN - driven VERB (O) manner NOUN (O) by ADP (O) clustering VERB (O) (Köhler NOUN (O) 1999 NUM) (O) or CCONJ (O) by ADP (O) measuring NOUN (O) [phoneme NOUN (B)] similarity NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) using VERB (O) confusion NOUN (O) matrix NOUN (O) (Andersen PROPN (O) et NOUN (O) al PROPN (O) 1993 NUM) , (O) or CCONJ (O) (iii PROPN) (O) both DET (O) i.e. X , (O) knowledge NOUN - based VERB (O) merging NOUN (O) followed VERB (O) by ADP (O) datadriven PROPN (O) clustering VERB (O) (Schultz PROPN (O) & Waibel PROPN (O) 1998 NUM (O) ; Köhler NOUN (O) 1999 NUM) .

 The DET (O) underlying VERB (O) assumption NOUN (O) here ADV (O) is AUX (O) that SCONJ (O) the DET (O) articulatory NOUN (O) representations NOUN (O) of ADP (O) phones NOUN (O) are AUX (O) similar ADJ (O) across ADP (O) languages NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) thus ADV (O) their DET (O) acoustic ADJ (O) realizations NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) considered VERB (O) [language NOUN (B) independent ADJ (I)] . 
 These DET (O) studies NOUN (O) were AUX (O) mostly ADV (O) done VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) framework NOUN (O) of ADP (O) modelling NOUN (O) [context NOUN - independent ADJ (B) phones NOUN (I)] . 
 The DET (O) approach NOUN (O) of ADP (O) knowledge NOUN - based VERB (O) merging NOUN (O) followed VERB (O) by ADP (O) [data NOUN - driven VERB (B) clustering VERB (I)] for ADP (O) [context NOUN - dependent ADJ (B) phone NOUN (I) models NOUN (I)] was AUX (O) further ADJ (O) investigated VERB (O) by ADP .

 In ADP (O) the DET (O) literature NOUN , (O) different ADJ (O) studies NOUN (O) have AUX (O) been AUX (O) reported VERB (O) for ADP (O) [cross ADJ - language ADJ (B) transfer NOUN (I)] , where ADV (O) an DET (O) [acoustic ADJ (B) model NOUN (I)] trained VERB (O) on ADP (O) a NOUN (O) different ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) many ADJ (O) different ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) (excluding VERB (O) [target NOUN (B) language NOUN (I)]) is AUX (O) (i NOUN) (O) used VERB (O) directly ADV (O) when ADV (O) no DET (O) data NOUN (O) from ADP (O) the DET (O) [target NOUN (B) language NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) available ADJ , (O) (ii PROPN) (O) adapted VERB (O) when ADV (O) limited ADJ (O) data NOUN (O) from ADP (O) [target NOUN (B) language NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) available ADJ , (O) or CCONJ (O) (iii PROPN) (O) used VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) seed NOUN (O) model NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) then ADV (O) trained VERB (O) with ADP (O) large ADJ (O) amount NOUN (O) of ADP (O) data NOUN . (O) 
 When ADV (O) compared VERB (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) use NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [monolingual ADJ (B) acoustic ADJ (I) models NOUN (I)] , it PRON (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) typically ADV (O) observed VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) acoustic ADJ (I) models NOUN (I)] yield NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) better ADJ (O) starting VERB (O) point NOUN (O) for ADP (O) such ADJ (O) [cross ADJ - language ADJ (B) transfer NOUN (I)] . 
 From ADP (O) the DET (O) above ADV (O) brief NOUN (O) literature NOUN (O) overview NOUN , (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) clear ADJ (O) that SCONJ (O) there PRON (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) reasonable ADJ (O) success NOUN (O) in ADP (O) constructing VERB (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) acoustic ADJ (I) models NOUN (I)] . 
 However ADV , (O) developing VERB (O) multilingual ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) is AUX (O) still ADV (O) an DET (O) open ADJ (O) issue NOUN . (O) 
 Standard PROPN (O) [ASR PROPN (B) systems NOUN (I)] typically ADV (O) use NOUN (O) [N PROPN - gram PROPN (B) language NOUN (I) models NOUN (I)] , where ADV (O) word NOUN (O) sequences NOUN (O) are AUX (O) modelled VERB (O) by ADP (O) a NOUN (O) N NOUN (O) th X (O) order NOUN (O) [Markov NOUN (B) chain NOUN (I)] , i.e. X , (O) the DET (O) model NOUN (O) consists VERB (O) of ADP (O) probability NOUN (O) to ADP (O) transit NOUN (O) to ADP (O) a NOUN (O) word NOUN (O) given VERB (O) a NOUN (O) word NOUN (O) sequence NOUN (O) of ADP (O) length NOUN (O) N8 PROPN . (O) 
 When ADV (O) estimating VERB (O) [N PROPN - gram PROPN (B) language NOUN (I) models NOUN (I)] for ADP (O) different ADJ (O) languages NOUN , (O) the DET (O) [language NOUN - specific ADJ (B)] characteristic ADJ (O) plays VERB (O) a NOUN (O) greater ADJ (O) role NOUN . (O) 
 For ADP (O) instance NOUN , (O) at ADP (O) the DET (O) word NOUN (O) level NOUN , (O) the DET (O) perplexity NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) language NOUN (O) can VERB (O) vary VERB (O) greatly ADV (O) depending VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) degree NOUN (O) of ADP (O) morphological ADJ (O) inflection NOUN . (O) 
 As SCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) result VERB , (O) morphologically ADV (O) rich ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) can VERB (O) have AUX (O) many ADJ (O) more ADJ (O) words NOUN , (O) thus ADV (O) leading VERB (O) to ADP (O) morphological ADJ - level NOUN (O) rather ADV (O) than SCONJ (O) word NOUN - level NOUN (O) representations NOUN .

 Also ADV , (O) some DET (O) morphologically ADV (O) rich ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) tend NOUN (O) to ADP (O) allow VERB (O) free ADJ (O) word NOUN (O) ordering NOUN , (O) which DET (O) is AUX (O) clearly ADV (O) not PART (O) well INTJ (O) handled VERB (O) by ADP (O) simple ADJ (O) [N PROPN - gram PROPN (B) models NOUN (I)] .

 In ADP (O) such ADJ (O) cases NOUN , (O) a NOUN (O) system NOUN (O) for ADP (O) word NOUN (O) segmentation NOUN (O) is AUX (O) necessary ADJ . (O) 
 In ADP (O) spite NOUN (O) of ADP (O) all DET (O) these DET (O) [language NOUN - specific ADJ (B) issues NOUN (I)] , there PRON (O) is AUX (O) need NOUN (O) for ADP (O) multilingual ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) to ADP (O) handle VERB , (O) for ADP (O) example NOUN , (O) instances NOUN (O) of ADP (O) ‘ PUNCT (O) code NOUN (O) switching9 NOUN ’ PUNCT .

 Research PROPN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) direction NOUN (O) of ADP (O) building NOUN (O) multilingual ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) has AUX (O) mainly ADV (O) focussed VERB (O) on ADP (O) (i NOUN) (O) estimation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) single ADJ (O) language NOUN (O) model NOUN (O) using VERB (O) the DET (O) data NOUN (O) from ADP (O) all DET (O) languages NOUN , (O) or CCONJ (O) (ii PROPN) (O) estimation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) language NOUN (O) model NOUN (O) for ADP (O) each DET (O) language NOUN (O) separately ADV (O) including VERB (O) the DET (O) words NOUN (O) from ADP (O) other ADJ (O) languages NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) interpolation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) these DET .

 [VTLN PROPN (B)] operates VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) principle NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) the DET (O) vocal NOUN (O) tract NOUN (O) length NOUN (O) varies VERB (O) across ADP (O) [different ADJ (B) speakers NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) formant NOUN (O) frequency NOUN (O)     positions NOUN (O) are AUX (O) inversely ADV (O) proportional ADJ (O) to ADP (O) this DET .

 Thus ADV , (O) by ADP (O) warping NOUN (O) the DET (O) frequency NOUN (O) scale NOUN (O) during ADP (O) [feature NOUN (B) extraction NOUN (I)] we PRON (O) are AUX (O) able ADJ (O) to ADP (O) approximately ADV (O) account NOUN (O) for ADP (O) this DET (O) variability NOUN (O) across ADP (O) listeners NOUN .

 An PROPN (O) additional ADJ (O) advantage NOUN (O) of ADP (O) using VERB (O) [VTLN PROPN (B)] in ADP (O) the DET (O) context NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [cross ADJ - lingual ADJ (B) adaptation NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) that SCONJ (O) it PRON (O) should VERB (O) be AUX (O) inherently ADV (O) independent ADJ (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) language NOUN (O) being NOUN (O) spoken VERB .

 If SCONJ (O) we PRON (O) wish NOUN (O) to ADP (O) bypass NOUN (O) the DET (O) [TTS PROPN (B) front ADJ - end NOUN (I)] , this DET (O) requires VERB (O) a NOUN (O) means VERB (O) to ADP (O) adapt NOUN (O) the DET (O) full ADJ - context NOUN (O) [TTS PROPN (B) acoustic ADJ (I) models NOUN (I)] from ADP (O) the DET (O) [triphone NOUN - context NOUN (B) labels NOUN (I)] generated VERB (O) by ADP (O) the DET (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] . 
 Several ADJ (O) approaches VERB (O) have AUX (O) been AUX (O) proposed VERB (O) to ADP (O) achieve VERB (O) this DET (O) end NOUN , (O) including VERB (O) a NOUN (O) method NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) transfers NOUN (O) regression NOUN (O) class NOUN (O) trees NOUN (O) from ADP (O) triphone NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) to ADP (O) full ADJ - context NOUN (O) models NOUN (O)     and CCONJ (O) approaches VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) consider VERB (O) triphone NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) full ADJ - context NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) using VERB (O) a NOUN (O) shared VERB (O) set NOUN (O) of ADP (O) parameters NOUN .

 We PRON (O) have AUX (O) proposed VERB (O) the DET (O) [decision NOUN (B) tree NOUN (I)] marginalization NOUN (O) approach NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) takes VERB (O) a NOUN (O) standard NOUN (O) set NOUN (O) of ADP (O) fullcontext PROPN (O) models NOUN (O) trained VERB (O) for ADP (O) [TTS PROPN (B)] and CCONJ (O) marginalizes VERB (O) out NOUN (O) the DET (O) contexts NOUN (O) irrelevant ADJ (O) to ADP (O) [ASR PROPN (B)] (e.g. ADV , (O) leaving VERB (O) triphone NOUN (O) only ADV (O) contexts PROPN) (O) (see VERB (O) figure NOUN) .

 The DET (O) results VERB (O) of ADP (O) this DET (O) first ADJ (O) study NOUN (O) showed VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) unsupervised ADJ (O) and CCONJ (O) supervised VERB (O) adaptation NOUN (O) using VERB (O) [maximum NOUN (B) likelihood NOUN (I)] linear ADJ (O) transformations NOUN (O) (MLLT PROPN) (O) gave VERB (O) similar ADJ (O) performance NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) intralingual ADJ (O) adaptation NOUN (O) scenario NOUN .

 It PRON (O) also ADV (O) should VERB (O) be AUX (O) apparent ADJ (O) that SCONJ (O) future NOUN (O) trends NOUN (O) will VERB (O) still ADV (O) closely ADV (O) follow NOUN (O) on ADP (O) from ADP (O) developments NOUN (O) made VERB (O) in ADP (O) mainstream NOUN (O) [speech NOUN (B) and CCONJ (I) language NOUN (I) technologies NOUN (I)] , but CCONJ (O) the DET (O) distinct ADJ (O) challenges VERB (O) of ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] will VERB (O) also ADV (O) give VERB (O) rise VERB (O) to ADP (O) novel NOUN (O) solutions NOUN .

 Similar PROPN (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) influence NOUN (O) of ADP (O) statistical ADJ (O) [machine NOUN (B) translation NOUN (I)] on ADP (O) developments NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] in ADP (O) recent ADJ (O) years NOUN , (O) we PRON (O) anticipate VERB (O) future NOUN (O) activity NOUN (O) will VERB (O) be AUX (O) strongly ADV (O) driven VERB (O) by ADP (O) web NOUN - based VERB (O) services NOUN , (O) especially ADV (O) those DET (O) for ADP (O) mobile NOUN (O) devices NOUN .

 We PRON (O) note NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) these DET (O) services NOUN (O) are AUX (O) becoming VERB (O) widely ADV (O) available ADJ (O) and CCONJ , (O) combined VERB (O) with ADP (O) affordable ADJ (O) broadband NOUN (O) wireless NOUN (O) access NOUN , (O) such ADJ (O) services NOUN (O) will VERB (O) provide VERB (O) an DET (O) opportunity NOUN (O) to ADP (O) make VERB (O) available ADJ (O) a NOUN (O) broader ADJ (O) range NOUN (O) of ADP (O) capabilities VERB (O) to ADP (O) mobile NOUN (O) devices NOUN , (O) especially ADV (O) those DET (O) based VERB (O) on ADP (O) computationally ADV (O) demanding VERB (O) tasks NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [MLSP PROPN (B)] .

 In ADP (O) the DET (O) domain NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [multilingual ADJ (B) ASR PROPN (I)] , methods NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [cross ADJ - language ADJ (B) knowledge NOUN (I) transfer NOUN (I)] still ADV (O) have AUX (O) considerable ADJ (O) potential NOUN . (O)
