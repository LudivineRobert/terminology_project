Even ADV (O) then ADV , (O) however ADV , (O) a NOUN (O) recording NOUN (O) script NOUN (O) must VERB (O) be AUX (O) prepared VERB , (O) a NOUN (O) [voice NOUN (B) talent NOUN (I)] recruited VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) [high ADJ - quality NOUN (B) speech NOUN (I)] recording VERB (O) carefully ADV (O) supervised VERB .

 [Lightly ADV - supervised ADJ (B) Audio PROPN (I) Segmentation NOUN (I)] 
Current PROPN (O) [parametric NOUN (B) TTS PROPN (I) systems NOUN (I)] generally ADV (O) use NOUN (O) [training NOUN (B) data NOUN (I)] which DET (O) is AUX (O) segmented VERB (O) into ADP (O) sentence NOUN - length NOUN (O) chunks NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) rarely ADV (O) make VERB (O) use NOUN (O) of ADP (O) contexts NOUN (O) beyond ADP (O) the DET (O) current ADJ (O) sentence NOUN .

Silence NOUN (O) marking VERB (O) is AUX (O) a NOUN (O) trivial ADJ (O) task NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) requires VERB (O) no DET (O) technical ADJ (O) knowledge NOUN . (O) 
Using VERB (O) the DET (O) initial NOUN (O) [training NOUN (B) data NOUN (I)] , standard NOUN (O) [Gaussian PROPN (B)] mixture NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) (GMMs NOUN) (O) with ADP (O) 16 NUM (O) components NOUN (O) are AUX (O) trained VERB (O) for ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) silence NOUN (O) respectively ADV .

The DET (O) distinction NOUN (O) between ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) silence NOUN (O) is AUX (O) made VERB (O) by ADP (O) calculating VERB (O) the DET (O) [log NOUN (B) likelihood NOUN (I)] ratio NOUN (O) (LLR PROPN) (O) of ADP (O) each DET (O) frame NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) framewise NOUN (O) LLR PROPN (O) is AUX (O) smoothed VERB (O) using VERB (O) a NOUN (O) moving VERB (O) median PROPN (O) filter NOUN . (O) 
While SCONJ (O) doing VERB (O) sentence NOUN (O) level NOUN (O) segmentation NOUN , (O) an DET (O) important ADJ (O) aspect NOUN (O) is AUX (O) to ADP (O) discriminate NOUN (O) between ADP (O) within ADP - sentence NOUN (O) breaks VERB , (O) and CCONJ (O) sentence NOUN (O) boundary ADJ (O) breaks NOUN .

 Demo PROPN (O) 
To NOUN (O) show NOUN (O) the DET (O) feasibility NOUN (O) of ADP (O) using VERB (O) a NOUN (O) corpus NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) compiled VERB (O) with ADP (O) such ADJ (O) minimal ADJ (O) intervention NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) [language NOUN - specific ADJ (B) expertise NOUN (I)] , we PRON (O) have AUX (O) used VERB (O) it PRON (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) demo NOUN (O) [TTS PROPN (B) voices NOUN (I)] in ADP (O) the DET (O) corpuslanguages NOUN . (O) 
To NOUN (O) build NOUN (O) these DET (O) voices NOUN (O) we PRON (O) first ADJ (O) select VERB (O) a NOUN (O) subset NOUN (O) of ADP (O) utterances VERB (O) spoken VERB (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) homogenous ADJ (O) style NOUN (O) using VERB (O) a NOUN (O) slightly ADV (O) supervised VERB (O) active ADJ (O) learning NOUN - based VERB (O) approach NOUN . (O) 
We PRON (O) then ADV (O) employ NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) [toolkit NOUN (B)] which DET (O) has AUX (O) been AUX (O) specifically ADV (O) designed VERB (O) to ADP (O) construct VERB (O) [TTS PROPN (B) front NOUN - ends NOUN (I)] while SCONJ (O) making NOUN (O) as SCONJ (O) few ADJ (O) implicit PROPN (O) assumptions NOUN (O) about ADP (O) the DET (O) [target NOUN (B) language NOUN (I)] as SCONJ (O) possible ADJ , (O) and CCONJ (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) configurable ADJ (O) with ADP (O) minimal ADJ (O) effort NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) expert NOUN (O) knowledge NOUN (O) to ADP (O) suit NOUN (O) arbitrary ADJ (O) new ADJ (O) [target NOUN (B) languages NOUN (I)] . 
The DET (O) modules NOUN (O) of ADP (O) our DET (O) [toolkit NOUN (B)] therefore ADV (O) rely VERB (O) where ADV (O) possible ADJ (O) on ADP (O) resources NOUN (O) which DET (O) are AUX (O) intended VERB (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) universal ADJ . (O) 
For ADP (O) example NOUN , (O) to ADP (O) tokenise NOUN (O) input NOUN (O) text NOUN (O) we PRON (O) rely VERB (O) on ADP (O) character NOUN (O) properties NOUN (O) given VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) Unicode PROPN (O) [character NOUN (B) database NOUN (I)] – PUNCT (O) a NOUN (O) regular ADJ (O) expression NOUN (O) defined VERB (O) over ADP (O) these DET (O) properties NOUN (O) has AUX (O) so CCONJ (O) far ADV (O) produced VERB (O) sensible NOUN (O) tokenisations NOUN (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) variety NOUN (O) of ADP (O) alphabetic PROPN (O) (Latin PROPN - based VERB , (O) Cyrillic PROPN) (O) and CCONJ (O) alphasyllabic NOUN (O) (Brahmic PROPN) (O) scripts NOUN .) (O) 
A NOUN (O) [letter NOUN - based VERB (B) approach NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) used VERB , (O) in ADP (O) which DET (O) the DET (O) names NOUN (O) of ADP (O) letters NOUN (O) are AUX (O) used VERB (O) directly ADV (O) as SCONJ (O) the DET (O) names NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B)] modelling VERB (O) units NOUN (O) (in ADP (O) place NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [phonemes NOUN (B)] of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) conventional ADJ (O) [front ADJ - end NOUN (B)]) . 
This DET (O) has AUX (O) given VERB (O) good ADJ (O) results VERB (O) for ADP (O) languages NOUN (O) with ADP (O) transparent ADJ (O) alphabetic ADJ (O) orthographies NOUN (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) Romanian PROPN , (O) Spanish PROPN (O) and CCONJ (O) Finnish PROPN , (O) and CCONJ (O) can VERB (O) give VERB (O) acceptable ADJ (O) results VERB (O) even ADV (O) for ADP (O) languages NOUN (O) with ADP (O) less ADJ (O) transparent ADJ (O) orthographies NOUN , (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) English PROPN . (O) 
Furthermore ADV , (O) our DET (O) tools NOUN (O) make VERB (O) no DET (O) use NOUN (O) of ADP (O) expert NOUN - specified VERB (O) categories NOUN (O) of ADP (O) letter NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) word NOUN , (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) [phonetic NOUN (B) categories NOUN (I)] (vowel NOUN , (O) nasal NOUN , (O) approximant NOUN , (O) etc X .) (O) and CCONJ (O) [part NOUN (B) of ADP (I) speech NOUN (I) categories NOUN (I)] (noun PROPN , (O) verb PROPN , (O) adjective NOUN , (O) etc X .) . (O) 
Instead ADV , (O) we PRON (O) use NOUN (O) features VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) are AUX (O) designed VERB (O) to ADP (O) stand VERB (O) in ADP (O) for ADP (O) such ADJ (O) expert NOUN (O) knowledge NOUN (O) but CCONJ (O) which DET (O) are AUX (O) derived VERB (O) fully ADV (O) automatically ADV (O) from ADP (O) the DET (O) distributional ADJ (O) analysis NOUN (O) of ADP (O) plain ADJ (O) text NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) [target NOUN (B) language NOUN (I)] . 
Samples NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) voices NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) heard VERB (O) at ADP (O) http://tundra.simple4all.org/demo/. PROPN (O) 
For ADP (O) reasons NOUN (O) of ADP (O) space NOUN (O) we PRON (O) refer NOUN (O) readers NOUN (O) interested ADJ (O) in ADP (O) full ADJ (O) presentation NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) evaluation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) thesesystems NOUN (O) to PART . (O) 

 Conclusion NOUN (O) 
We PRON (O) have AUX (O) introduced VERB (O) a NOUN (O) first ADJ (O) version NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [Simple4All PROPN (B) Tundra PROPN (I) corpus PROPN (I)] , and CCONJ (O) described VERB (O) its DET (O) construction NOUN (O) from ADP (O) readily ADV (O) available ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B) data NOUN (I)] . 
14 NUM (O) audiobooks VERB (O) in ADP (O) 14 NUM (O) languages NOUN (O) have AUX (O) been AUX (O) so CCONJ (O) far ADV (O) included VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) corpus NOUN (O) along ADP (O) with ADP (O) their DET (O) orthographic NOUN (O) transcripts NOUN . (O) 
[Tundra PROPN (B)] will VERB (O) be AUX (O) extended ADJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) future NOUN (O) with ADP (O) other ADJ (O) types NOUN (O) of ADP (O) imperfect NOUN , (O) found VERB (O) data NOUN , (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) lectures NOUN , (O) or CCONJ (O) parliamentary ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B)] , data NOUN (O) which DET (O) have AUX (O) a NOUN (O) higher ADJ (O) degree NOUN (O) of ADP (O) spontaneity NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) expressivity NOUN . (O) 
We PRON (O) will VERB (O) also ADV (O) aim NOUN (O) at ADP (O) making NOUN (O) available ADJ (O) finer ADV - grained VERB (O) alignments VERB (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) data NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) also ADV (O) more ADJ (O) elaborate VERB (O) prosodic PROPN (O) annotations NOUN , (O) such ADJ (O) as SCONJ (O) style NOUN (O) diarisation NOUN , (O) emphasis NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) sentiment NOUN (O) analysis NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) [TTS PROPN (B) systems NOUN (I)] built VERB (O) from ADP (O) this DET (O) corpus PROPN (O) demonstrate NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) first ADJ (O) application NOUN (O) of ADP (O)     the DET (O) [Tundra PROPN (B) corpus NOUN (I)] , and CCONJ (O) support NOUN (O) its DET (O) usefulness NOUN .
