 With ADP (O) the DET (O) increase NOUN (O) in ADP (O) power NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) resources NOUN (O) of ADP (O) computer NOUN (O) technology NOUN , (O) building NOUN (O) natural ADJ (O) sounding VERB (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voices NOUN (I)] has AUX (O) progressed VERB (O) from ADP (O) a NOUN (O) knowledge NOUN - based VERB (O) activity NOUN (O) to ADP (O) a NOUN (O) data NOUN - based VERB (O) one NUM .

Rather ADV (O) than SCONJ (O) handcrafting NOUN (O) each DET (O) [phonetic NOUN (B) unit NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) its DET (O) applicable ADJ (O) contexts PROPN , (O) [high ADJ - quality NOUN (B) synthetic NOUN (I) voices NOUN (I)] may VERB (O) be AUX (O) built VERB (O) from ADP (O) sufficiently ADV (O) diverse NOUN (O) [single ADJ (B) speaker NOUN (I) databases NOUN (I)] of ADP (O) natural ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B)] . 
We PRON (O) can VERB (O) see VERB (O) a NOUN (O) progression NOUN (O) from ADP (O) sxed VERB (O) inventories NOUN , (O) found VERB (O) in ADP (O) diphone NOUN (O) systems NOUN (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) more ADJ (O) general ADJ , (O) but CCONJ (O) more ADJ (O) resource NOUN (O) consuming VERB , (O) techniques NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] where ADV (O) appropriate ADJ (O) [sub ADJ - word NOUN (B) units NOUN (I)] are AUX (O) automatically ADV (O) selected VERB (O) from ADP (O) [large ADJ (B) databases NOUN (I)] of ADP (O) natural ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B)] .

The DET (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) output NOUN (O) derives VERB (O) directly ADV (O) from ADP (O) the DET (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) recordings NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) it PRON (O) appears VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) the DET (O) larger ADJ (O) the DET (O) database NOUN (O) the DET (O) better ADJ (O) the DET (O) coverage NOUN . (O) 
Commercial PROPN (O) systems NOUN (O) have AUX (O) exploited VERB (O) these DET (O) technique NOUN (O) to ADP (O) bring VERB (O) us PROPN (O) a NOUN (O) new ADJ (O) level NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) speech NOUN (I)] . 
However ADV , (O) although SCONJ (O) certainly ADV (O) successful ADJ , (O) there PRON (O) is AUX (O) always ADV (O) the DET (O) issue NOUN (O) of ADP (O) spurious ADJ (O) errors NOUN . (O) 
When ADV (O) a NOUN (O) desired VERB (O) sentence NOUN (O) happens VERB (O) to ADP (O) require VERB (O) [phonetic NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) [prosody NOUN (B) contexts NOUN (I)] that DET (O) are AUX (O) under ADP (O) represented VERB (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) database NOUN , (O) the DET (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) synthesizer NOUN (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) severely ADV (O) degraded VERB . (O) 
Even ADV (O) though SCONJ (O) this DET (O) may VERB (O) be AUX (O) a NOUN (O) rare ADJ (O) event NOUN , (O) a NOUN (O) single ADJ (O) bad ADJ (O) join VERB (O) in ADP (O) an DET (O) utterance NOUN (O) can VERB (O) ruin NOUN (O) the DET (O) listeners NOUN (O) ƀow NOUN . (O) 
It PRON (O) is AUX (O) not PART (O) possible ADJ (O) to ADP (O) guarantee NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) bad ADJ (O) joins VERB (O) and/or CCONJ (O) inappropriate ADJ (O) units NOUN (O) do AUX (O) not PART (O) occur VERB , (O) simply ADV (O) because SCONJ (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) vast ADJ (O) number NOUN (O) of ADP (O) possible ADJ (O) combinations NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) could VERB (O) occur VERB . (O) 
However ADV (O) for ADP (O) particular ADJ (O) applications NOUN (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) often ADV (O) possible ADJ (O) to ADP (O) almost ADV (O) always ADV (O) avoid NOUN (O) them PRON . (O)

(O) 
However ADV (O) in ADP (O) spite NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) desire NOUN (O) for ADP (O) perfect ADJ (O) synthesis NOUN (O) all DET (O) the DET (O) time NOUN , (O) there PRON (O) are AUX (O) limitations VERB (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) technique NOUN (I)] . 
No NOUN (O) (or CCONJ (O) little ADJ) (O) modiscation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) selected VERB (O) pieces NOUN (O) of ADP (O) natural ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B)] are AUX (O) carried VERB (O) out ADP , (O) thus ADV (O) limiting NOUN (O) the DET (O) output NOUN (O) [speech NOUN (B)] to PART (O) the DET (O) style NOUN (O) of ADP (O) that SCONJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) original ADJ (O) recordings NOUN .

With ADP (O) a NOUN (O) desire NOUN (O) for ADP (O) more ADJ (O) control NOUN (O) over ADP (O) the DET (O) [speech NOUN (B) variation NOUN (I)] , [larger ADJ (B) databases NOUN (I)] containing VERB (O) examples VERB (O) of ADP (O) different ADJ (O) styles NOUN (O) are AUX (O) required VERB . (O) 
IBM PROPN ’s PART (O) stylistic ADJ (O) synthesis NOUN (O) is AUX (O) a NOUN (O) good ADJ (O) example NOUN (O) but CCONJ (O) is AUX (O) limited ADJ (O) by ADP (O) the DET (O) amount NOUN (O) of ADP (O) variations NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) can VERB (O) be AUX (O) recorded VERB . (O) 
In ADP (O) direct ADJ (O) contrast NOUN (O) to ADP (O) this DET (O) selecting NOUN (O) of ADP (O) actual ADJ (O) instances NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B)] from ADP (O) a NOUN (O) database NOUN , (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) speech NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] has AUX (O) also ADV (O) grown VERB (O) in ADP (O) popularity NOUN (O) over ADP (O) the DET (O) last ADJ (O) few ADJ (O) years NOUN . (O) 
[Statistical PROPN (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] might VERB (O) be AUX (O) most ADJ (O) simply ADV (O) described VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) generating NOUN (O) the DET (O) average NOUN (O) of ADP (O) some DET (O) set NOUN (O) of ADP (O) similarly ADV (O) sounding VERB (O) [speech NOUN (B) segments NOUN (I)] . 
This DET (O) contrasts VERB (O) directly ADV (O) with ADP (O) the DET (O) desire NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] to PART (O) keep VERB (O) the DET (O) natural ADJ (O) unmodised ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B) units NOUN (I)] , but CCONJ (O) using VERB (O) parametric NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) offers VERB (O) other ADJ (O) benests NOUN . (O) 
In ADP (O) both DET (O) the DET (O) [Blizzard PROPN (B) Challenge PROPN (I)] 2005 NUM (O) and CCONJ (O) 2006 NUM (O) where ADV (O) a NOUN (O) common ADJ (O) [speech NOUN (B) database NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) provided VERB (O) to ADP (O) participants NOUN (O) to ADP (O) build NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) [synthetic NOUN (B) voice NOUN (I)] , the DET (O) results VERB (O) from ADP (O) listening NOUN (O) tests VERB (O) have AUX (O) shown VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) one NUM (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) instances NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) techniques NOUN (I)] called VERB (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) generation NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] (or CCONJ (O) even ADV (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) synthesis NOUN (I)]) offers VERB (O) more ADJ (O) preferred ADJ (O) (through ADP (O) [MOS PROPN (B) tests NOUN (I)]) and CCONJ (O) more ADJ (O) understandable ADJ (O) (through ADP (O) [WER NOUN (B) scores NOUN (I)]) synthesis NOUN . (O) 
Although SCONJ (O) even ADV (O) the DET (O) proponents VERB (O) of ADP (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] feel VERB (O) that DET (O) the DET (O) best ADJ (O) examples VERB (O) of ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] are AUX (O) better ADJ (O) than SCONJ (O) the DET (O) best ADJ (O) examples VERB (O) of ADP (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] , overall ADJ (O) it PRON (O) appears VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] has AUX (O) already ADV (O) reached VERB (O) a NOUN (O) quality NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) can VERB (O) stand VERB (O) in ADP (O) its DET (O) own ADJ (O) right INTJ . (O) 
The DET (O) quality NOUN (O) issue NOUN (O) really ADV (O) comes VERB (O) down ADP (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) fact NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) given VERB (O) a NOUN (O) parametric NOUN (O) representation NOUN (O) it PRON (O) is AUX (O) necessary ADJ (O) to ADP (O) reconstruct NOUN (O) the DET (O) [speech NOUN (B)] from ADP (O) those DET (O) parameters NOUN .

The DET (O) reconstruction NOUN (O) process NOUN (O) is AUX (O) still ADV (O) not PART (O) ideal ADJ . (O) 
Although SCONJ (O) modeling NOUN (O) the DET (O) [spectral NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) [prosody NOUN (B) features VERB (I)] is AUX (O) relatively ADV (O) well INTJ (O) desned VERB , (O) models NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) residual ADJ (O) / excitation NOUN (O) are AUX (O) still ADV (O) yet CCONJ (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) fully ADV (O) developed VERB , (O) though SCONJ (O) composite NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) like INTJ (O) STRAIGHT PROPN (O) are AUX (O) proving VERB (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) useful ADJ .

The DET (O) following VERB (O) section NOUN (O) gives VERB (O) a NOUN (O) more ADJ (O) formal ADJ (O) desnition NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) techniques NOUN (I)] that DET (O) will VERB (O) allow VERB (O) a NOUN (O) easier ADJ (O) contrast NOUN (O) it PRON (O) to ADP (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] . 
Then ADV (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) speech NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) more ADJ (O) formally ADV (O) desned VERB , (O) speciscally ADV (O) based VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) implementation NOUN (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) speech NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) system NOUN (I)] (HTS PROPN) . (O) 
The DET (O) snal NOUN (O) sections NOUN (O) discuss VERB (O) some DET (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) advantages NOUN (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) framework NOUN (I)] highlighting VERB (O) some DET (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) existing VERB (O) a NOUN (O) future NOUN (O) directions NOUN .

 Overview NOUN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) typical ADJ (O) system NOUN (O) 

 Though SCONJ (O) in ADP (O) this DET (O) case NOUN (O) k NOUN (O) may VERB (O) include VERB (O) [spectral NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) [acoustic ADJ (B) features VERB (I)] . 
Weights PROPN (O) (w NOUN (O) tj NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) w NOUN (O) ck PROPN) (O) have AUX (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) found VERB (O) for ADP (O) each DET (O) feature NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) actually ADV (O) implementations NOUN (O) used VERB (O) a NOUN (O) combination NOUN (O) of ADP (O) trained VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) hand NOUN (O) tuned VERB (O) weights NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) second NOUN (O) direction NOUN , (O) use NOUN (O) a NOUN (O) clustering VERB (O) method NOUN (O) that DET (O) allows VERB (O) the DET (O) target NOUN (O) cost NOUN (O) to ADP (O) effectively ADV (O) be AUX (O) precalculated VERB . (O) 
Units NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) same ADJ (O) type NOUN (O) are AUX (O) clustered ADJ (O) into ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [decision NOUN (B) tree NOUN (I)] that DET (O) asks VERB (O) questions NOUN (O) about ADP (O) features VERB (O) available ADJ (O) at ADP (O) synthesis NOUN (O) time NOUN (O) (e.g. ADV (O) [phonetic NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) [prosody NOUN (B) context NOUN (I)]) . 
All DET (O) of ADP (O) these DET (O) techniques NOUN (O) depend VERB (O) on ADP (O) a NOUN (O) acoustic ADJ (O) distance NOUN (O) measure NOUN (O) which DET (O) should VERB (O) be AUX (O) correlated VERB (O) with ADP (O) human NOUN (O) perception NOUN . (O) 
These DET (O) apparently ADV (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] specisc PROPN (O) issues NOUN (O) are AUX (O) mentioned VERB (O) here ADV (O) because SCONJ (O) they PRON (O) have AUX (O) specisc PROPN (O) counterparts NOUN (O) in ADP (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] . 
Figure NOUN (O) 1 NUM (O) is AUX (O) a NOUN (O) block NOUN (O) diagram PROPN (O) of ADP (O) a NOUN (O) typical ADJ (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) speech NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) system NOUN (I)] . 
It PRON (O) consists VERB (O) of ADP (O) training NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) synthesis NOUN (O) parts NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) training NOUN (O) part NOUN (O) is AUX (O) similar ADJ (O) to ADP (O) those DET (O) used VERB (O) in ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) recognition NOUN (I) systems NOUN (I)] . 
The DET (O) main ADJ (O) difference NOUN (O) is AUX (O) that SCONJ (O) both DET (O) [spectrum NOUN (B)] (e.g. ADV , (O) [melcepstral NOUN (B) coefficients NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) their DET (O) [dynamic ADJ (B) features VERB (I)]) and CCONJ (O) excitation NOUN (O) (e.g. ADV , (O) log NOUN (O) F PROPN (O) 0 PUNCT (O) and CCONJ (O) its DET (O) [dynamic ADJ (B) features VERB (I)]) parameters NOUN (O) are AUX (O) extracted VERB (O) from ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [speech NOUN (B) database NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) modeled VERB (O) by ADP (O) [context NOUN - dependent ADJ (B) HMMs PROPN (I)] ([phonetic ADJ (B)] , linguistic ADJ , (O) and CCONJ (O) prosodic PROPN (O) contexts NOUN (O) are AUX (O) taken VERB (O) into ADP (O) account NOUN) . (O) 
To NOUN (O) model NOUN (O) log NOUN (O) F0 NOUN (O) sequence NOUN (O) which DET (O) includes VERB (O) unvoiced ADJ (O) regions NOUN (O) properly ADV , (O) multi ADJ - space ADJ (O) probability NOUN (O) distributions NOUN (O) are AUX (O) used VERB (O) for ADP (O) the DET (O) state NOUN (O) output NOUN (O) stream NOUN (O) for ADP (O) log NOUN (O) F0 PROPN . (O) 
Each DET (O) [HMM PROPN (B)] has AUX (O) state NOUN (O) duration NOUN (O) densities VERB (O) to ADP (O) model NOUN (O) the DET (O) temporal NOUN (O) structure NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B)] . 
As SCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) result VERB , (O) the DET (O) system NOUN (O) models NOUN (O) [spectrum NOUN (B)] , excitation NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) durations NOUN (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) unised ADJ (O) framework NOUN . (O) 
The DET (O) synthesis NOUN (O) part NOUN (O) does AUX (O) the DET (O) inverse NOUN (O) operation NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) recognition NOUN (I)] . 
First ADV , (O) an DET (O) arbitrarily ADV (O) given VERB (O) text NOUN (O) corresponding VERB (O) an DET (O) utterance NOUN (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) synthesized VERB (O) is AUX (O) converted VERB (O) to ADP (O) a NOUN (O) [context NOUN - dependent ADJ (B) label NOUN (I) sequence NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) then ADV (O) the DET (O) utterance NOUN (O) [HMM PROPN (B)] is AUX (O) constructed VERB (O) by ADP (O) concatenating VERB (O) the DET (O) contextdependent NOUN (O) [HMMs NOUN (B)] according VERB (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) label NOUN (O) sequence NOUN . (O) 
Secondly ADV , (O) state NOUN (O) durations NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [HMM PROPN (B)] are AUX (O) determined ADJ (O) based VERB (O) on ADP (O) the DET (O) state NOUN (O) duration NOUN (O) [probability NOUN (B) density NOUN (I) functions NOUN (I)] . 
Thirdly ADV , (O) the DET (O) [speech NOUN (B) parameter NOUN (I) generation NOUN (I) algorithm PROPN (I)] (typically ADV , (O) case NOUN (O) 1 NUM (O) in ADP) (O) generates VERB (O) the DET (O) [sequence NOUN (B) of ADP (I) mel PROPN - cepstral ADJ (I) coefficients NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) log NOUN (O) F PROPN (O) 0 PUNCT (O) values NOUN (O) that SCONJ (O) maximize NOUN (O) their DET (O) output NOUN (O) probabilities NOUN . (O) 
Finally ADV , (O) a NOUN (O) [speech NOUN (B) waveform PROPN (I)] is AUX (O) synthesized VERB (O) directly ADV (O) from ADP (O) the DET (O) generated VERB (O) [mel PROPN - cepstral ADJ (B) coefficients NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) F0 NOUN (O) values NOUN (O) using VERB (O) the DET (O) MLSA PROPN (O) slter NOUN (O) with ADP (O) binary NOUN (O) pulse NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) noise NOUN (O) excitation NOUN . (O) 

 Advantages NOUN (O) and CCONJ (O) disadvantages NOUN (O) 

 The DET (O) biggest ADJ (O) disadvantage NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) generation NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) approach NOUN (I)] against ADP (O) the DET (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) approach NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) the DET (O) quality NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [synthesized VERB (B) speech NOUN (I)] . 
There PRON (O) seems VERB (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) three NUM (O) factors NOUN (O) which DET (O) degrade NOUN (O) the DET (O) quality NOUN (O) : [vocoder NOUN (B)] , modeling VERB (O) accuracy NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) over ADV - smoothing VERB . (O)

 Relation NOUN (O) between ADP (O) two NUM (O) approaches VERB (O) 

 Some DET (O) of ADP (O) clustering NOUN - based VERB (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) approaches VERB (I)] uses VERB (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) state NOUN (I) clustering VERB (I)] .

The DET (O) essential ADJ (O) difference NOUN (O) between ADP (O) the DET (O) clustering NOUN - based VERB (O) [unit NOUN - selection NOUN (B) approach NOUN (I)] and CCONJ (O) the DET (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) generation NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) approach NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) that SCONJ (O) each DET (O) cluster NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) generation NOUN (O) approach NOUN (O) is AUX (O) represented VERB (O) by ADP (O) statistics NOUN (O) of ADP (O) the DET (O) cluster NOUN (O) instead ADV (O) of ADP (O) multi ADJ - templates ADJ (O) of ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) units NOUN (I)] . 
In ADP (O) the DET (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) generation NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) approach NOUN (I)] , distributions NOUN (O) for ADP (O) [spectrum NOUN (B)] , F0 PROPN , (O) and CCONJ (O) duration NOUN (O) are AUX (O) clustered ADJ (O) independently ADV . (O)

On ADP (O) the DET (O) other ADJ (O) hand NOUN , (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) systems NOUN (I)] often ADV (O) use NOUN (O) regression NOUN (O) trees NOUN (O) (or CCONJ (O) [CART PROPN (B)]) for ADP (O) [prosody NOUN (B) prediction NOUN (I)] .

However ADV , (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I) systems NOUN (I)] , leaves VERB (O) of ADP (O) one NUM (O) of ADP (O) trees NOUN (O) must VERB (O) have AUX (O) [speech NOUN (B) waveforms NOUN (I)] : other ADJ (O) trees NOUN (O) are AUX (O) used VERB (O) to ADP (O) calculate NOUN (O) target NOUN (O) costs VERB , (O) to ADP (O) prune PROPN (O) [waveform PROPN (B)] candidates NOUN , (O) or CCONJ (O) to ADP (O) give VERB (O) features VERB (O) for ADP (O) constructing VERB (O) the DET (O) trees NOUN (O) for ADP (O) [speech NOUN (B) waveforms NOUN (I)] . 
It PRON (O) is AUX (O) noted VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) generation NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I) approach NOUN (I)] , likelihoods NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [static NOUN (B) feature NOUN (I)] parameters VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) [dynamic ADJ (B) feature NOUN (I)] parameters VERB (O) corresponds VERB (O) to ADP (O) the DET (O) target NOUN (O) costs VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) concatenation NOUN (O) costs VERB , (O) respectively ADV .

It PRON (O) is AUX (O) easy ADJ (O) to ADP (O) understand VERB , (O) if SCONJ (O) we PRON (O) approximate NOUN (O) each DET (O) state NOUN (O) output NOUN (O) distribution NOUN (O) by ADP (O) a NOUN (O) discrete NOUN (O) distribution NOUN (O) or CCONJ (O) instances NOUN (O) of ADP (O) frame NOUN (O) samples NOUN (O) in ADP (O) the DET (O) cluster NOUN (O) : when ADV (O) the DET (O) [dynamic ADJ (B) feature NOUN (I)] is AUX (O) calculated VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) the DET (O) difference NOUN (O) between ADP (O) neighboring NOUN (O) [static NOUN (B) features VERB (I)] , the DET (O) ML PROPN - based VERB (O) generation NOUN (O) results NOUN (O) in ADP (O) a NOUN (O) frame NOUN - wise ADJ (O) DP PROPN (O) search NOUN (O) like INTJ (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] . 
Thus ADV (O) [HMM PROPN - based VERB (B) parameter NOUN (I) generation NOUN (I)] can VERB (O) be AUX (O) viewed VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) an DET (O) analogue NOUN (O) version NOUN (O) of ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] .

Some DET (O) of ADP (O) these DET (O) approaches VERB (O) use NOUN (O) [spectrum NOUN (B) parameters NOUN (I)] , F PROPN (O) 0 PUNCT (O) values NOUN , (O) and CCONJ (O) durations NOUN (O) (or CCONJ (O) a NOUN (O) part NOUN (O) of ADP (O) them PRON) (O) generated VERB (O) from ADP (O) [HMM PROPN (B)] to PART (O) calculate NOUN (O) acoustic ADJ (O) target NOUN (O) costs VERB (O) for ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] . 
Similarly ADV , (O) [HMM PROPN (B) likelihoods NOUN (I)] are AUX (O) used VERB (O) as SCONJ (O) “ PUNCT (O) costs VERB (O) ” PUNCT (O) for ADP (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] .

 We PRON (O) can VERB (O) see VERB (O) that SCONJ (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) speech NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] offers VERB (O) a NOUN (O) wide ADJ (O) range NOUN (O) of ADP (O) techniques NOUN (O) to ADP (O) improve VERB (O) spoken VERB (O) output NOUN . (O) 
Its DET (O) more ADJ (O) complex NOUN (O) models NOUN , (O) when ADV (O) compared VERB (O) to ADP (O) standard NOUN (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] , allow VERB (O) for ADP (O) general NOUN (O) solutions NOUN , (O) without ADP (O) necessarily ADV (O) requiring VERB (O) recording NOUN (O) [speech NOUN (B)] in ADP (O) all DET (O) [phonetic NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) prosodic PROPN (O) contexts PROPN . (O) 
The DET (O) pure ADJ (O) [unit NOUN (B) selection NOUN (I)] view NOUN (O) requires VERB (O) very ADV (O) [large ADJ (B) databases NOUN (I)] to PART (O) cover NOUN (O) examples VERB (O) of ADP (O) all DET (O) desired VERB (O) prosodic PROPN , (O) [phonetic NOUN (B)] and CCONJ (O) stylistic ADJ (O) variation NOUN .

In ADP (O) contrast NOUN (O) [statistical ADJ (B) parametric NOUN (I) synthesis NOUN (I)] allows VERB (O) for ADP (O) models NOUN (O) to ADP (O) be AUX (O) combined VERB (O) and CCONJ (O) adapted VERB (O) thus ADV (O) not PART (O) requiring VERB (O) instances NOUN (O) of ADP (O) all DET (O) possible ADJ (O) combinations NOUN (O) of ADP (O) contexts PROPN .
