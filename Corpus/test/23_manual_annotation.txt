[Multilingual speech-to-speech translation System] in Mobile Off-line Environment

ABSTRACT
The process of translating [speech-to-speech] denotes the conversion of [speech signals] specifically from the original [source language] into a distinctive [speech signal-bearing] identical meaning or resolve into the [target language]. To achieve such, there is a need to adopt coordinated cooperation of the separate [Human Language Technology] components. In particular, the most significant elements in a [speech translation system] encompass the [automatic speech recognition], [machine translation] as well as [text to speech]. With this understanding, the current paper explores the design as well as architectural building blocks linked to the “Translator” [speech-to-speech translation system]. In addition, the current paper explores their interactions with each other to ease [speech-to-speech translation] in terms of reliability, scalability, and potentially distribution.
